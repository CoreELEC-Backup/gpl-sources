Description: userspace USB HID development files
 libhid provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with USB
 HID devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based on
 libusb, thus it requires no HID support in the kernel and provides means to
 take control over a device even if the kernel governs it.
 .
 This package provides the development files and static library for libhid.
 You need this if you want to develop an application with libhid.
