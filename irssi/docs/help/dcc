                     's' - send
                     'c' - chat

%9Description:%9

    The DCC protocol is used to initiate client-to-client chat connections
    and file transfers.

    If you are behind NAT, or if the firewall is too restrictive, you might
    want to try if using the passive parameter resolves your connection
    problem.

    You can send files which contain special character or spaces by enclosing
    the filename within quotes. For example: 'my file with spaces.txt'.

    /DCC GET bob "summer vacation.mkv"
    /DCC SEND sarah "summer vacation.mkv"
