	<para>Normally queries for 0x1C names (all logon servers for a domain)
	will return the first address of the 0x1B names (domain master browser
	and PDC) as first address in the result list. As many client only use
	the first address in the list by default, all clients will use the same
	server (the PDC). Windows servers have an option to disable this
	behavior (since Windows 2000 Service Pack 2).
