    fatlabel: Make sure printf style patterns in label are not expanded
    
    Writing a label to an unlabeled filesystem involves creating a root
    directory entry to contain the label. For this, the
    alloc_rootdir_entry() function used for creating new directory nodes for
    recovered orphan cluster chains is reused. However, this expects the
    filename to be a printf style pattern to generate a unique name.
    
    If the filesystem is unlabeled and the new label contains a printf
    specifier other than %d or similar, the attempted expansion of the
    pattern might crash fatlabel.
    
    Change alloc_rootdir_entry() to take an additional argument gen_name and
    only expand the name if its value is true.

    fsck: Fix reporting of length to truncate with shared clusters
    
    When files share clusters and one of the two files has been selected to
    truncate fsck reports which file has been selected and the length to
    which it will be truncated. All code paths erronously printed the length
    of the file that was not going to be truncated, leading to possible user
    confusion.

    Request minimum automake version 1.11 and add workaround for <1.13
    
    Before automake 1.13, parallel-tests wasn't the default set it
    explicitly in the automake options list. The parallel test harness was
    introduced in 1.11 therefore that is the minimum now.
    
    However, the AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT variable was only starting to work in
    1.13, so there is now a version check and a conditional assignment to
    TESTS_ENVIRONMENT (which should be for user setting only) in case
    automake is 1.11 or 1.12.
    
    Without it, the fact of xxd being found is not passed to the test
    scripts which then skip all tests due to perceived lack of xxd.

Author: Andreas Bombe <aeb@debian.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 12 19:51:10 2016 +0200

    Fix truncation logic in circular chain check
    
    When scanning for circular chains, the first FAT entry that appeared a
    second time in a chain should cause the previous cluster to be the
    termination of the chain.
    
    To that end, test_file() keeps variables to point to the previous
    cluster and the current number of clusters. When the -t option is given,
    all clusters are checked to be readable and skipped (variables not
    updates) in test_file() when they are not.
    
    The problem was that the variables were updated only when the read check
    succeeded. If the -t option is not given, that check does not happen and
    the variables keep their initial value. The circular chain fix would
    then always truncate to zero length and fail to update the free cluster
    count, requiring a second fsck run.
    
    Fix by updating these variables unconditionally when -t option is not
    given.

    read_boot(): Handle excessive FAT size specifications
    
    The variable used for storing the FAT size (in bytes) was an unsigned
    int. Since the size in sectors read from the BPB was not sufficiently
    checked, this could end up being zero after multiplying it with the
    sector size while some offsets still stayed excessive. Ultimately it
    would cause segfaults when accessing FAT entries for which no memory
    was allocated.
    
    Make it more robust by changing the types used to store FAT size to
    off_t and abort if there is no room for data clusters. Additionally
    check that FAT size is not specified as zero.
    
    Fixes #25 and fixes #26.

    Reinstate alignment of FAT32 structures to cluster size
    
    This reverts commits 17c956cb9 and d63e0d627 where the alignment was

    the aligned filesystem. The option -a is already provided to disable
    alignment in order to handle such cases.
    
    This change brings it back in line with FAT12/16 where alignment wasn't
    disabled and brings consistency with the current command line options,
    where only the option to disable alignment exists but no opposite option
    to enable it.

    mkfs: Improve parsing of bad blocks file
    
    The bad blocks file that can be given to mkfs via the -l option had a
    very simplistic design. It failed to notice it was parsing an empty
    line and would report errors for that.
    
    Replace it with a more robust version that ignores empty lines as well
    as leading and trailing white space. Additionally it produces meaningful
    error messages.

    mkfs: Limit filesystem size on targets that are too large
    
    For FAT filesystems, the number of sectors has to fit into a 32 bit
    variable. Previously this was not checked possibly causing invalid
    filesystems to be generated.
    
    Now there is a check for that case which will limit the number of
    sectors if needed and print a warning that disk space will be left
    unused in that case.

    mkfs: Improved bounds checking in mark_FAT_sector()/mark_FAT_cluster()
    
    In mark_FAT_sector() the sector number itself is now checked against
    limits instead of the computed cluster number. Even with sector number
    before the start of the data area, the cluster number may be valid for
    the first cluster due to dividing by the cluster size.
    
    Both functions now check for upper limits and should prevent writing
    past the valid end of the FAT.

    mkfs: Fix offset error in FAT12/16 bad cluster marking
    
    The root directory wasn't factored in to the calculation of the data
    area start sector. On FAT32 the root directory is in the data area, but
    for FAT12 and FAT16 it is a reserved space before the start of the data
    area.
    
    On FAT12 and FAT16, this resulted in the wrong clusters being marked
    during bad blocks mapping, whether from check_blocks() or from reading
    the user supplied bad blocks file.

    mkfs: Fix off-by-2 error in bad cluster marking
    
    mark_FAT_sector(), which has the mark_sector_bad() macro as its sole
    user, computed the cluster number corresponding to the sector by taking
    its offset from the first data sector and dividing by sectors per
    cluster.
    
    What it missed was that the first data cluster is number 2 and not 0.
    This meant all marks were off by 2 and when the first two clusters are
    supposed to be marked, it would overwrite the reserved cluster values
    and create an invalid filesystem.

    Remove name/extension split in directory entry structures
    
    Both the DIR_ENT structure in fsck.fat.h and the msdos_dir_entry in
    msdos_fs.h - these represent the on disk format of directory entries -
    had the name field split into name[8] followed by ext[3].
    
    By far the most operations on name are on the full name including
    extension and they treated the name field as an 11 byte array. This is
    an array overflow that worked because the structs have the attribute
    packed and the extension field is following right after.
    
    Nevertheless, this is not clean C and the merging of both fields
    actually simplified the code in a few places.

    Use just device size not major number in Atari mode
    
    In Atari mode, read_boot() in boot.c used the device major number to
    determine whether to use FAT12. It would always use FAT12 for a floppy,
    otherwise only if it is a RAM disk or loopback device and has a size
    corresponding to standard floppy formats.
    
    Since this check was already broken for a long time (another place that
    assumed 8 bit major numbers) and there is no real point to make the
    distinction based on device, this commit reduces the check to just
    compare against standard floppy sizes.

    mkfs.fat: Complete overhaul of device probing
    
    The device probing in mkfs.fat is used to get device parameters where
    needed and also to decide whether to refuse overwriting a device due to
    possible user error. This code has suffered severe bitrot and is highly
    Linux specific. Highlights include using hardcoded major/minor device
    numbers to classify a device, and using 8 bits major/minor numbers that
    have become obsolete a long time ago and thus often misidentifying a
    device.
    
    The overhauled implementation is now in src/device_info.c and makes use
    of libudev (optional, recommended) and libblkid (required) to probe the
    device and where Linux ioctls are required it provides fallbacks and
    does not attempt to call these on non-Linux systems. The FAT parameter
    selection has been unified and simplified in the process.
    
    A new executable testdevinfo has been added that gets built but not
    automatically installed. It takes one file name, uses the same probing
    as mkfs.fat would with verbose messages enabled and displays the
    results.

    set_fat(): Fix off-by-2 error leading to corruption in FAT12
    
    In FAT12 two 12 bit entries are combined to a 24 bit value (three
    bytes). Therefore, when an even numbered FAT entry is set in FAT12, it
    must be be combined with the following entry. To prevent accessing
    beyond the end of the FAT array, it must be checked that the cluster is
    not the last one.
    
    Previously, the check tested that the requested cluster was equal to
    fs->clusters - 1. However, fs->clusters is the number of data clusters
    not including the two reserved FAT entries at the start so the test
    triggered two clusters early.
    
    If the third to last entry was written on a FAT12 filesystem with an
    odd number of clusters, the second to last entry would be corrupted.
    This corruption may also lead to invalid memory accesses when the
    corrupted entry becomes out of bounds and is used later.
    
    Change the test to fs->clusters + 1 to fix.

    Convert build system to autoconf/automake
    
    In preparation for fixing the horribly outdated and broken device
    checking - which will likely involve using additional libraries like
    libblkid - as well as making this package portable to other operating
    systems, the build system is now the tried and true autoconf/automake
    combination which should make both goals a little more straightforward.
    
    The release version number and date are now in configure.ac and
    substituted by configure where they are needed. Now it is no longer
    necessary to change the number in multiple places for a release and the
    man pages get the number substituted directly into them, making the
    update-version.sh script and the VERSION file obsolete.
    
    The English man pages are moved back up one directory to mark their
    status as the master copy for all translations. At the moment the po4a
    translation infrastructure is defunct since it isn't integrated into
    the automake environment yet. So far it hasn't been used, so that is
    not an actual regression.
    
    The date in the man pages is not automatically updated anymore. This is
    as it should be, since the date is supposed to signify the time of the
    last nontrivial change and not the release date of the software.

    fsck: Verify first cluster of a file is not 1
    
    Previously the FAT was checked for any out of bounds entries which were
    cleared. However the first cluster of a file, as specified in its
    directory entry, was not verified to not be 1.
    
    In addition to missing this filesystem error, code that correctly
    assumes the FAT contained no bad entries anymore could still look up
    invalid table indices depending on the value stored in entry 1. With
    the right values and FAT size this can lead to a segfault by accessing
    unallocated memory.
    
    Now test_file() will ignore files where the first cluster equals 1 and
    an additional check in check_file() will truncate them.

    Simplify synopses of man pages
    
    Since there is only one mode of invocation for the tools, it is
    somewhat pointless to list every possible option in the synopsis.
    
    Fix a few style inconsistencies in addition, specifically that
    placeholders for option arguments are in capital letters and should be
    shown where the option is described.

    When a FAT12 filesystem contains an odd number of clusters, setting the

    Fix attempt to rename root dir in fsck due to uninitialized fields
    
    When add_file() is called with offset 0, it will construct a DIR_ENT for
    the root directory instead of reading the contents from the filesystem.
    It did not initialize the whole DIR_ENT on the stack, just select
    values.
    
    In particular, the lcase field was left with an undefined value. If
    that value happened to include the FAT_NO_83NAME bit, the "neither long
    nor short file name" check in bad_name() added in 3.0.26 would trigger
    and cause an attempt to rename the entry (which is not possible).
    Example run:
    
        $ /sbin/fsck.fat -y bad.img
        fsck.fat 3.0.26 (2014-03-07)
        /
          Bad short file name ().
          Auto-renaming it.
          Renamed to
        bad.img: 14 files, 19388/403266 clusters
    
    This commit changes the initialization zeroize the whole struct before
    setting individual fields. Thanks to AlexisM, who found the cause and
    posted a patch on the Debian bug http://bugs.debian.org/764992 .

commit c24ecb6
Author: Andreas Bombe <aeb@debian.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 11 22:49:50 2014 +0100

    Support long file names in volume labeling code
    
    The code to find the volume label directory entry in find_volume_de()
    did not consider long file names so far. Directory entries that make up
    long file names have four attribute bits set, including the "volume"
    bit.
    
    This caused the code to mistake a directory entry that is part of a
    long file name as the volume name entry. If such an entry is found
    first, fatlabel would print garbage when asked to display the label and
    mangle the long file name when asked to set it. The latter would lead
    to the loss of the long file name and require a fsck to clean up.
    
    Change so that the set of attributes equal that of LFN entries will no
    langer match as a volume label.

Author: Dir Lotter <dirk.lotter@siemens.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 7 18:25:39 2014 +0100

    Fix "odd" files created by frequent power-loss.
    
    After running many power losses the filesystem can degrate, containing "odd"
    files making the filesystem corrupt that could not be solved by fsck:
    
      * file was not visible in a ls -l
      * ls -i reported a "invalid file name" on the console
      * a test program with diropen/dirread showed the file, a stat on this file
        failed
      * file was not accessible and could not be deleted
    
    After digging into the code we found why fsck didn't repair the file system:
    One thing was we don't have short filenames. Another issue was that the LFN
    pointer was set to NULL and so it looked like we didn't have short and long
    filenames.
    
    Our patch of check.c includes:
    
      * returns 1 from function bad_name() in case no short and no long filename
        exist
      * auto_rename() and rename_file() got a special handling for the case no short
        file name exist:
        - it enables the short file name (we think here was a weakness of the old
          code: it changed the short filename but didn't enabled it in the
          file->dir_ent.lcase entry)
        - it reset all attributes except ATTR_DIR and ATTR_VOLUME
    
    This solved our problem pretty well.

    of the Windows tool "h2format" (www.heise.de/download/h2format.html),
    I found that the remaining problems were caused by rounding of the
    reserved sectors and FAT space to cluster size (the h2format tool
    doesn't do this).

commit e048a8d
Author: Martin Wilck <mwilck@arcor.de>
Date:   Wed Jun 12 11:33:33 2013 +0200

    Fixing default sectors per cluster for FAT32 (Closes: #690062).
    
    The default sectors per cluster calculated by mkdosfs are outdated,
    see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938438.aspx.
    
    The deviations may cause some 3rd party devices (e.g. TechniSat DVB
    receivers) to hang when reading mkdosfs generated file systems.

Date:   Mon Apr 22 12:29:51 2013 +0100

    Allow operation on SH4 CPUs and remove compiler warnings.
    
    Simplify the GET_UNALIGNED_W macro and use it in all cases instead of making it
    conditional on CPU types. This missed some CPUs that needed it (e.g. SH4), and
    in any case the implementation caused "dereferencing type-punned pointer will
    break strict-aliasing rules" warnings.
    
    Enable extra warnings, but disable signed comparison and missing field
    initializer warnings as these are not helpful.
    
    Update write_boot_label() so that the boot_sector_16 and boot_sector cases are
    handled separately instead of using an aliased pointer, as that causes
    "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules" warnings.
    
    Make date_dos2unix(), usage() and cdiv() static functions as they are only used
    in the files in which they are declared.
    
    Update bad_name() and lfn_get() so that the extension is processed separately
    instead of by indexing past the end of the name field as that causes "array
    subscript is above array bounds" warnings.
    
    Update the dosfsck() main function to avoid a warning that free_clusters may
    be used uninitialized. Do not print the final count of files and clusters when
    dosfsck is run with the "-b" option because the used files and clusters have
    not been counted in this case.
    
    Alter the setup_tables() function so that it does not cause an "array subscript
    is below array bounds" warning.

Date:   Tue Jun 7 19:19:30 2011 +0200

    Correcting miscalculation of sector number in some cases.
    
    mkdosfs will incorrectly calculate the number of sectors of a
    given FAT partition if the number sectors are odd due to
    count_blocks incorrectly handling the remainder of a division
    operation. This miscalculation causes the OMAP4 bootloader to
    fail to boot.
    
    This bug can be observed by comparing the total sector size in
    fdisk expert more to fsck.msdos; this discrepancy only shows up
    when the number of sectors are odd.

commit a5961d7
Author: Steven J. Magnani <steve@digidescorp.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 21 16:58:11 2010 +0100

    When compiling a 32-bit version of dosfstools on an x86_64 machine,
    the resulting applications report strange errors on "large" (> 2 GiB)
    partitions:
    
      Seek to -2118967808:Invalid argument
    
      Warning: Filesystem is FAT32 according to fat_length and fat32_length fields,
      but has only 8613 clusters, less than the required minimum of 65525.
      This may lead to problems on some systems.
    
    This appears to be due to compilation with a 32-bit off_t and lseek() library
    function.
    
    Use lseek64 for positioning, and change some suspect uses of off_t to loff_t.

Date:   Fri Jan 8 09:16:38 2010 +0100

    mkdosfs: correct alignment of the root directory.
    
    Correct the code to align the root directory; it was broken before
    since bs.dir_entries had already been set at the point of alignment.
    This patch removes the dual use of bs.dir_entries and root_dir_entries
    to carry the same information: the information is carried in
    root_dir_entires exclusively, and then bs.dir_entries is set inside
    setup_tables() at a late point.
    
    The code to align the root directory is also wrapped in
    if (align_structures); this avoids rounding the number of root
    directory entries up to a whole sector when used with -a
    (i.e. preserves the previous behavior.)

    mkdosfs: by default align all structures to cluster boundaries
    
    Align all data structures (reserved sectors, FATs, root directory for
    FAT12/16) to an even multiple of the cluster size. This means that if
    the partition is aligned, so will all clusters be. This adds
    significant performance for anything where the physical sector size is
    larger than the logical sector size, e.g. flash media or large-sector
    hard disks.

    Patch to check for bad number of clusters in dosfsck:

      * For FAT32 filesystems with less than 65525 a warning message will be

    Applying Suses dosfstools-2.11-mkdosfs-geo0.diff from Ludwig Nussel
    <lnussel@suse.de> to fix handling of zero heads and sectors:
    
      * the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl works on device mapper devices but returns
        zero heads and sectors. Therefore let's a) assume dummy values in
        that case in mkdosfs and b) don't consider such fat file systems as
        invalid in dosfsck. The Linux kernel accepts them anyways.
