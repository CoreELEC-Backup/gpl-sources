Package psx provides a CGo backed API for invoking system calls in a
way that each system call is mirrored on all pthreads of the combined
Go/CGo runtime. Since the Go runtime treats all pthreads as
interchangeable, a feature like this is needed to meaningfully change
process privilege (including dropping privilege) in a Go program
running on Linux. This package is required by:

   "kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/libcap/cap"

The functionality is implemented by a C library: libpsx, which is
distributed with the libcap. The official release announcement site
for libcap and libpsx is:

   https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/

Like libcap/libpsx itself, the psx package is distributed with a "you
choose" License. Specifically: BSD three clause, or GPL2. See the
LICENSE file.
