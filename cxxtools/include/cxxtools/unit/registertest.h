        Tests can be registered easily with the RegisterTest<> class
        template to an Unit::Application at program initialisation.
        A typical example looks like this:

        @code
            class MyTest : public Unit::TestCase
            { ... };

            RegisterTest<MyTest> _registerMyTest;
        @endcode

        The constructor of the RegisterTest class template will
        register an instance of its template parameter to the
        application.
