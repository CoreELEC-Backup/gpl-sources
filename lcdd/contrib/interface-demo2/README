may be someone else will find our little testing setup also helpful ?!

i attached it to this mail (since it's just 28K though i didn't clean up the files ...)
and one can download it from the "Test/demo" link at
http://www.pyramid.de/en/products/programmable_lcd.php
respectively
http://www.pyramid.de/upload/files/divers/demo_for_pylcd-lcdproc.tgz

AFAIK it will be quite easy to adapt it to other LCDs

HTH & keep up the good work

regards,
thomas
