README.docbook
--------------

The documentation for LCDproc is written in DocBook,
to be exact: DocBook V4.x XML.

You can generate the documentation of LCDproc using 'xmlto',
which is a shell-script frontend to an XML toolchain.

Get it from http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/xmlto/ or pre-packaged
from your distribution.

To convert the Admin Guide to a single XHTML document, simply do:

$ xmlto xhtml-nochunks lcdproc-dev.docbook

See xlmto's man page for further conversion targets.


In earlier releases it was possible to convert the LCDproc documentation
using the Docbook utilities, but unfortunately this is not possible any
more.

$ docbook2html lcdproc-dev.docbook

should create HTML documents, but currently fails.

Unfortunately I am not expert enough in DocBook and SGML to find out why.
If you find out the cause of this failure, please do not hesitate to post
the fix tho the LCDproc mailing list.
