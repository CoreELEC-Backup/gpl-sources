About DVBiscovery
=================

DVBiscovery is a shell script that tries to tune a number of frequencies
(from a config file), and stops after it has found a match. It then dumps
the output of DVBlast to the standard output, so that an external process
can parse it and find relevant information there. Typically, you would
want to get the network ID from the NIT, which unically identifies the
network you are on.

DVBiscovery is therefore a sort of scanning program, but doesn't aim at
exhaustivity (there are already programs doing that). It tries to guess
where you are without any external information.
