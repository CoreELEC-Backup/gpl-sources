This directory contains executable shell scripts, that are intended for
use with the
  -m address -M exec /path/to/an/executable
Directive in /etc/smartd.conf.

Details about how to use this Directive may be found in the man pages for
smartd and smartd.conf.
  man 8 smartd
  man 5 smartd.conf
should display those pages on your system.

please email them to <smartmontools-support@listi.jpberlin.de>,
