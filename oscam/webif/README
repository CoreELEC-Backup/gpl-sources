This directory holds all pages that are used in OSCam WebIf along with
program that builds pages.{c,h} files used by the OSCam build system.

The build system is intelligent enough to rebuild pages.{c,h} files when
any file mentioned in pages_index.txt is changed or pages_index.txt itself
is changed.

If you want change WebIf pages just edit files in the directory that
interests you then build OSCam as you normally do.

Any file must be described in pages_index.txt

Files in the root directory:
  Makefile          - Build system file.
  pages_gen.c       - The program that generates pages.c and pages.h files.
  pages_index.txt   - This file contains mapping of template names to
                      file names and describes template's config dependecies.
  pages_index_check - Script that checks if every file is found.
  pages_mkdep       - Used by the build system to generate file dependencies.
