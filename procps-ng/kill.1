.TH KILL 1 "2018-05-31" "procps-ng" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
kill \- send a signal to a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kill
[options] <pid> [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The default signal for kill is TERM.  Use
.B \-l
or
.B \-L
to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP,
INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in
three ways:
.BR \-9 ", " \-SIGKILL
or
.BR \-KILL .
Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see
the PGID column in ps command output.  A PID of
.B \-1
is special; it indicates all processes except the kill process itself
and init.

wrote kill in 1999 to replace a bsdutils one that was not standards
