%9Description:%9

    Executes the specified command in the background; the process can be
    accessed by its id or the name you gave it.

    The output of the process can be redirected to various targets, such as
    a window, a channel, a nickname or a query.

    The process identifier must always begin with the '%%' character. For
    example %%0.

    If you remove a process with the close parameter, it will only make Irssi
    detach from it; the process will keep running until it terminates.

%9Examples:%9

    /EXEC ls

    /EXEC -close mailserver
