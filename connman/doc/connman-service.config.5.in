.SH NAME
service-name.config \- ConnMan service provisioning file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @storagedir@/\fIservice-name\fB.config
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fIConnMan\fP's services are configured with so called
"\fBprovisioning files\fP" which reside under \fI@storagedir@/\fP.
The files can be named anything, as long as they end in \fB.config\fP.
The provisioning files can be used to configure for example secured
wireless access points which need complex authentication, for example
eduroam, or for static IPs and so on. Each provisioning file can be
used for multiple services at once.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.P
The configuration file consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.
Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed
in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section
or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
.P
Description of sections and available keys follows:
.SS [global]
This section is optional, and can be used to describe the actual file. The
two allowed fields for this section are:
.TP
.BI Name= name
Name of the network.
.TP
.BI Description= description
Description of the network.
.SS [service_*]
Each provisioned service must start with a [service_*] tag, with * replaced
by an unique name within the file.
The allowed fields are:
.TP
.B Type=ethernet \fR|\fB wifi
Mandatory. Other types than ethernet or wifi are not supported.
.TP
.BI IPv4=off \ \fR|\  dhcp\ \fR|\  network / netmask / gateway
IPv4 settings for the service. If set to \fBoff\fP, IPv4 won't be used.
If set to \fBdhcp\fP, dhcp will be used to obtain the network settings.
\fInetmask\fP can be specified as length of the mask rather than the
mask itself. The gateway can be omitted when using a static IP.
.TP
.BI IPv6=off \ \fR|\  auto\ \fR|\  network / prefixlength / gateway
IPv6 settings for the service. If set to \fBoff\fP, IPv6 won't be used.
If set to \fBauto\fP, settings will be obtained from the network.
.TP
.B IPv6.Privacy=disabled \fR|\fB enabled \fR|\fB preferred
IPv6 privacy settings as per RFC3041.
.TP
.BI MAC= address
MAC address of the interface to be used. If not specified, the first
found interface is used. Must be in format ab:cd:ef:01:23:45.
.TP
.BI DeviceName= ifname
Device name the interface to be used, e.g. eth0. MAC takes preference
over DeviceName.
.TP
.BI Nameservers= servers
Comma separated list of nameservers.
.TP
.BI SearchDomains= domains
Comma separated list of DNS search domains.
.TP
.BI Timeservers= servers
Comma separated list of timeservers.
.TP
.BI Domain= domain
Domain name to be used.
.TP
The following keys can only be used for wireless networks:
.TP
.BI Name= name
A string representation of an network SSID. If the SSID field is
present, the Name field is ignored. If the SSID field is not present,
this field is mandatory.
.TP
.BI SSID= ssid
SSID: A hexadecimal representation of an 802.11 SSID. Use this format to
encode special characters including starting or ending spaces.
.TP
.BI Passphrase= passphrase
RSN/WPA/WPA2 Passphrase.
.TP
.BI Security= type
The security type of the network. Possible values are \fBpsk\fP
(WPA/WPA2 PSK), \fBieee8021x\fP (WPA EAP), \fBnone\fP and \fBwep\fP.
When not set, the default value is \fBieee8021x\fP if an EAP type is
configured, \fBpsk\fP if a passphrase is present and \fBnone\fP otherwise.
.TP
.B Hidden=true \fR|\fB false
If set to \fBtrue\fP, then this AP is hidden. If missing or set to
\fBfalse\fP, then AP is not hidden.
.TP
The following keys are used for WPA EAP (when \fBSecurity=ieee8021x\fP):
.TP
.B EAP=tls \fR|\fB ttls \fR|\fB peap
EAP type to use. Only \fBtls\fP, \fBttls\fP and \fBpeap\fP are supported.
.TP
.BI CACertFile= file
Path to the CA certificate file. Only PEM and DER formats are supported.
.TP
.BI PrivateKeyFile= file
Path to the private key file. Only PEM, DER and PFX formats are supported.
.TP
.BI PrivateKeyPassphrase= passphrase
Passphrase of the private key.
.TP
.B PrivateKeyPassphraseType=fsid
If specified, use the private key's fsid as the passphrase, and ignore the
PrivateKeyPassphrase field.
.TP
.BI Identity= identity
Identity string for EAP.
.TP
.BI AnonymousIdentity= identity
Anonymous identity string for EAP.
.TP
.BI SubjectMatch= substring
Substring to be matched against the subject of the
authentication server certificate for EAP.
.TP
.BI AltSubjectMatch= substring
Semicolon separated string of entries to be matched against the alternative
subject name of the authentication server certificate for EAP.
.TP
.BI DomainSuffixMatch= domain
Constraint for server domain name. If set, this FQDN is used as a suffix match
requirement for the authentication server certificate for EAP.
.TP
.BI DomainMatch= domain
This FQDN is used as a full match requirement for the
authentication server certificate for EAP.
.TP
.BI Phase2= type
Inner authentication type with for \fBEAP=tls\fP or \fBEAP=ttls\fP. Prefix
the value with \fBEAP-\fP to indicate usage of EAP-based authentication
method (should only be used with \fBEAP=ttls\fP).
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.SS Eduroam
This is a configuration file for eduroam networks. This file could for
example be @storagedir@/eduroam.config. Your university's exact
settings might be different.
.PP
.nf
[service_eduroam]
Type = wifi
Name = eduroam
EAP = peap
Phase2 = MSCHAPV2
CACertFile = /etc/ssl/certs/UNIV_CA.crt
.fi
.SS Complex networking
This is a configuration file for a network providing EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS and
EAP-PEAP services. The respective SSIDs are tls_ssid, ttls_ssid and peap_ssid
and the file name could be @storagedir@/complex.config.
.PP
Please note that the SSID entry is for hexadecimal encoded SSID (e.g. "SSID =
746c735f73736964"). If your SSID does not contain any exotic character then
you should use the Name entry instead (e.g. "Name = tls_ssid").
