<p>
The atilibusb driver offers support for many RF devices sporting
usb receivers with the X10 chip, Some of these are X10 branded, other sold
under names such as ATI or Medion.</p>
<p>
Typical dmesg output for hotplugging such a device:
<pre>
usb 3-1: new low-speed USB device number 23 using xhci_hcd
usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0bc7, idProduct=0006
usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 3-1: Product: RF receiver
usb 3-1: Manufacturer: X10 WTI
</pre>
The driver conflicts with the linux atiusb kernel module. Thus, to use
atilibusb  the kernel module must be blacklisted. This can be done with a
file named e. g., /etc/modprobe.d/lirc-blacklist with the following
content
<pre>
    # blacklist drivers which conflict with lirc userspace drivers.
    blacklist ati_remote
    blacklist lirc_atiusb
</pre>
<p>
The module autodetects available devices and a --device argument is normally
not required. However, if given an existing device as argument this will be
used. It has support for enumerating available devices e. g., using
<i>mode2 -l </i>.  </p>
