    <para>
    This option only takes effect when the <smbconfoption name="security"/> option is set to
    <constant>domain</constant> or <constant>ads</constant>.
    If it is set to yes (the default), winbindd periodically tries to scan for new
    trusted domains and adds them to a global list inside of winbindd.
    The list can be extracted with <command>wbinfo --trusted-domains --verbose</command>.
    This matches the behaviour of Samba 4.7 and older.</para>

    <para>The construction of that global list is not reliable and often
    incomplete in complex trust setups. In most situations the list is
    not needed any more for winbindd to operate correctly.
    E.g. for plain file serving via SMB using a simple idmap setup
    with <constant>autorid</constant>, <constant>tdb</constant> or <constant>ad</constant>.
    However some more complex setups require the list, e.g.
    if you specify idmap backends for specific domains.
    Some pam_winbind setups may also require the global list.</para>

    <para>If you have a setup that doesn't require the global list, you should set
    <smbconfoption name="winbind scan trusted domains">no</smbconfoption>.
