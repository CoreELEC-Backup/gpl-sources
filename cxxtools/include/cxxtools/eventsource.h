/** @brief Sends Events to receivers in other threads

    The Signal class is not thread-safe and can only be used for
    intra-thread communication. To pass Events between different threads
    use an %EventSource instead. Thread-safety only refers to the usage
    of the %EventSource itself (connection, disconnecting...) and not the
    slot.
    Construction and destruction must always occur in isolation.
