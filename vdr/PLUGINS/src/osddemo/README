Description:

Demonstration of how a plugin can have its very own OSD setup.

It's a very primitive game that opens a small window in which the
user can draw lines with the Up, Down, Left and Right buttons.
The color buttons are used to switch color.

On a VDR system with TrueColor support it displays some of the
possibilities available with the TrueColor OSD. Once the "Animation"
pixmap is displayed, it can be moved around with the Up, Down, Left
and Right buttons. The Red button turns off the "Tiled Pixmaps"
display, and the Green button toggles the color display.

In both variants of the demo, pressing the '1' key displays all
possible ellipses that can be drawn with the DrawEllipse() function,
while pressing the '2' key shows all possible slopes the DrawSlope()
function can draw.

Press Ok to close the window.
