/*
 * The persistent filter is filter layer that sits above the other filters and
 * caches the final result of those other filters.  When a device is first
 * checked against filters, it will not be in this cache, so this filter will
 * pass the device down to the other filters to check it.  The other filters
 * will run and either include the device (good/pass) or exclude the device
 * (bad/fail).  That good or bad result propagates up through this filter which
 * saves the result.  The next time some code checks the filters against the
 * device, this persistent/cache filter is checked first.  This filter finds
 * the previous result in its cache and returns it without reevaluating the
 * other real filters.
 *
 * FIXME: a cache like this should not be needed.  The fact it's needed is a
 * symptom of code that should be fixed to not reevaluate filters multiple
 * times.  A device should be checked against the filter once, and then not
 * need to be checked again.  With scanning now controlled, we could probably
 * do this.
