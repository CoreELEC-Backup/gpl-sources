	<para>If this parameter is enabled, then
	explicit (from the client) and implicit (via the scavenging) name releases
	are propagated to the other servers directly, even if there are still other
	addresses active, this applies to SPECIAL GROUP (2) and MULTIHOMED (3) entries.
	Also the replication conflict merge algorithm for SPECIAL GROUP (2) entries
	discards replica addresses where the address owner is the local server,
	if the address was not stored locally before. The merge result is
	propagated directly in case an address was discarded.
	A Windows servers doesn't propagate name releases of SPECIAL GROUP (2)
	and MULTIHOMED (3) entries directly, which means that Windows servers may
	return different results to name queries for SPECIAL GROUP (2) and MULTIHOMED (3)
	names. The option doesn't have much negative impact if Windows servers are
	around, but be aware that they might return unexpected results.
