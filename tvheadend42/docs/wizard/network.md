Now let's get your tuners configured. Go ahead and select a network for
each of the tuners you would like to use. if you do not assign a
network to a tuner it will __not__ be used.

**Selecting the Right Network**:


Many tuners are able to receive different signal types..

**If you receive your channels through an antenna (also known as an aerial)**
then you would select the network under the tuners with DVB-T/ATSC-T/ISDB-T
in the name.

**If you receive your channels through a satellite dish** then you would
select the network under the tuners with DVB-S/S2 in the name.

**If you receive your channels via cable** then you would select the
network under the tuners with DVB-C/ATSC-C/ISDB-C in the name.


**Notes**:


* Tuners already in use will not appear below.
* If using IPTV, the playlist you enter must contain valid links to
  streams using codecs supported by Tvheadend.
* For devices with multiple tuners (e.g. either cable or terrestrial),
  be aware that many only allow you to use one tuner at a time.
  Selecting more than one tuner per device can thus result in unexpected
  behavior.
