.TH SYSCTL.CONF "5" "2019-09-21" "procps-ng" "File Formats"
.SH NAME
sysctl.conf \- sysctl preload/configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sysctl.conf
is a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in and set by
.BR sysctl .
The syntax is simply as follows:
.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
# comment
; comment

token = value
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a token or
value is ignored, although a value can contain whitespace within.  Lines which
begin with a # or ; are considered comments and ignored.

If a line begins with a single \-, any attempts to set the value that fail will be
ignored.

.SH NOTES
As the
.BR /etc/sysctl.conf
file is used to override default kernel parameter values, only a small number of parameters is predefined in the file.
Use
.IR /sbin/sysctl\ \-a
or follow
.BR sysctl (8)
to list all possible parameters. The description of individual parameters can be found in the kernel documentation.
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
# sysctl.conf sample
#
  kernel.domainname = example.com
; this one has a space which will be written to the sysctl!
  kernel.modprobe = /sbin/mod probe
.fi
