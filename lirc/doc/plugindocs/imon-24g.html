                      The asccociation process of the iMON 2.4G DT/LT remote.

                    <P>
                      Due to the design (could probably have been
                      better), an application needs to have an open
                      connection to the lirc-daemon*, to allow the
                      association process to start.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                      To associate the remote you need 2 terminals.
                    <DL>

                      <DT>1 To:</DT><DD>Find the &quot;sys&quot; entry and
                        start the association process</DD>

                      <DT>2 To:</DT><DD>Start a process that has a connection
                      open to the lirc-daemon</DD>

                    </DL>

                    The example is shown for bash but sould be quite easy to adapt for (t)csh

# file=`find /sys -name associate_remote`   |
                                            |# irw

                    Then you hold down a button on the remote. And soon the
                    &quot;irw&quot; process should start to spit out keycodes.


                    Just stop <EM>(Ctrl-C)</EM> the &quot;irw&quot; process,
                    and you should be good to go.

                    *) This is because the USB device connection is
                    only initialized when the lirc-daemon gets a
                    connection to an application, and when it is
                    closed, the USB device connection gets closed
                    too. So only in this period it is possible to send
                    packages to the usb-device.
