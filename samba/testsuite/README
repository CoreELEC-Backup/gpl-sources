README for testsuite directory
------------------------------

The Samba testsuite is divided up into the following subdirectories.

    - lib	      Various library files used by tool directories
    
    - nsswitch        Tests for nsswitch extensions

All the scripts require an unreleased
version of DejaGNU, and although they contain some useful tests they
are not so useful at the moment.  All scripts are migrating to a
single test framework, Satyr.  <cvs://cvs.samba.org/data/cvs/satyr>
