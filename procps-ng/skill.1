poorly defined.  Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep
commands instead.
.PP
The default signal for skill is TERM.  Use \-l or \-L to list
available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT,
KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in three
ways: \-9 \-SIGKILL \-KILL.
.PP
The default priority for snice is +4.  Priority numbers range from
+20 (slowest) to \-20 (fastest).  Negative priority numbers are
restricted to administrative users.
