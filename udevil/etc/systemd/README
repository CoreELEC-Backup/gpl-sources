devmon systemd service
======================

Note: If using a sysconfdir other than /etc or an install prefix other than
/usr, the file devmon@.service must be edited to use the correct paths.

To Install: (this is done by the build system)

    cd etc/systemd
    install -Dm644 devmon /etc/conf.d/devmon
    install -Dm644 devmon@.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/devmon@.service

To Start: (this is not done automatically)

    systemctl start devmon@<user>
