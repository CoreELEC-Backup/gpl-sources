Template: inadyn/wizard
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want help creating your /etc/inadyn.conf?
 This configuration wizard can help you create a basic /etc/inadyn.conf
 which you can later edit.
 .
 If you want to update more than one record at the same provider, or
 configure a custom DDNS provider, edit /etc/inadyn.conf when this
 wizard has completed.
 .
 NOTE: remove the ##DEBCONF## from /etc/inadyn.conf to prevent future
 upgrades or reinstall of the package to overwrite your changes.

Template: inadyn/provider
Type: select
Choices: Dyn, FreeDNS, Loopia, nsupdate, duckdns, no-ip.com, dynv6.com, tunnelbroker
Default: FreeDNS
Description: Dynamic DNS provider:
 This is just a selection of all the DDNS providers Inadyn supports.  If
 you cannot find your provider in this list, select one and then edit
 the /etc/inadyn.conf file by hand to set up a custom one.
 .
 See the man page for inadyn(8) and inadyn.conf(5) for more information.

Template: inadyn/username
Type: string
Description: Your DDNS provider username:

Template: inadyn/password
Type: password
Description: Your DDNS provider password:
 When Inadyn has been (re)configured the password is removed from
 the debconf db, but it will be visible from /etc/inadyn.conf for
 anyone with root access.

Template: inadyn/hostname
Type: string
Description: Your DDNS provider hostname, or similar:
 For some providers, most notably Tunnelbroker, the hostname must be
 an 'update-key', or similar, and not the actual hostname.  For most
 use-cases, however, the hostname is something like this:
 .
 hostname.provider.tla
