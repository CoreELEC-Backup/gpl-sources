	NEWS: Note the fix for the s390 bug

2019-09-30  Viktor Mihajlovski  <mihajlov@linux.ibm.com>

	libparted/s390: Re-enabled virtio-attached DASD heuristics
	DASDs attached to KVM guest as virtio-blk devices are only handled
	properly, if the unique DASD geometry is detected. Commit id
	61dd3d4c5eb782eb43caa95342e63727db3f8281 has prevented proper geometry
	detection. Fixed by making sure that HDIO_GETGEO takes precedence
	on s390[x].

	libparted: Fix bug in bsd.c alpha_bootblock_checksum
	I flubbed this in e35af6cbc43f5b279e6f0d65ccc904b1ac6c63d2 by trying to
	switch to using a pointer and ended up writing off the end. Switch the
	loop in alpha_bootblock_checksum back to use [i] index. It's easier
	to read anyway.

	doc: Create po directory if missing
	When running 'make distcheck' the directory tree it uses is created
	without the po directory. Create it if it is missing.

	dist-check.mk: Remove empty .deps directories
	Borrowed from coreutils commits 373ba16f332d and 40434e566e52

	Turn off c_prohibit_gnu_make_extensions

	po: Add argmatch.h

	bsd.c: Rewrite disklabel code to prevent gcc warnings
	Constructing a pointer into a char array results in warnings about casting
	changing alignment. This changes how the boot sector is handled by adding the
	label to BSDDiskData with the correct offset (64 bytes).

	Add gcc malloc attribute to ped_alloc and ped_calloc

	libparted: Replace abs() with llabs()
	GCC 9 fails to compile a few C source files which call abs() function.
	An example of the error messages was as follows:

	  CC       dos.lo
	dos.c: In function '_best_solution':
	dos.c:1773:13: error: absolute value function 'abs' given an argument of type 'long long int' but has parameter of type 'int' which may cause truncation of value [-Werror=absolute-value]
	 1773 |   a_delta = abs (part->geom.start - a->start);
	      |             ^~~
	dos.c:1774:13: error: absolute value function 'abs' given an argument of type 'long long int' but has parameter of type 'int' which may cause truncation of value [-Werror=absolute-value]
	 1774 |   b_delta = abs (part->geom.start - b->start);
	      |             ^~~
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

	To avoid the errors, replace abs() function calls with llabs().

	sun.c: Aligned _SunRawLabel to 16bit boundary

	gpt.c: Drop cast of efi_guid_t to unsigned char *
	This confuses gcc, making it think the uuid_t is unaligned when it really comes
	from a efi_guid_t entry in _GPTDiskData.

	gpt.c: Align _GPTDiskData to 8 byte boundary

	dvh.c: Use memcpy instead of strncpy
	The strings are short, so using memcpy isn't much slower (if at all).  This
	fixes gcc complaining about strncpy possibly copying a non-terminated string.

	include/parted/unit.in.h: Specify const attribute to ped_unit_get_name()
	GCC 8 fails to compile libparted/unit.c with an error:

	  CC       unit.lo
	unit.c:155:1: error: function might be candidate for attribute 'const' [-Werror=suggest-attribute=const]
	 ped_unit_get_name (PedUnit unit)
	 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  CC       disk.lo
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

	Const attribute is required for the function ped_unit_get_name() because
	its return value is not affected by program status. To avoid the build
	failure, change attribute of the function from pure to const.

2019-08-09  Shin'ichiro Kawasaki  <kawasaki@juno.dti.ne.jp>

	libparted/labels/pt-tools.c: Fix gperf generated function attribute
	GCC 8 fails to compile libparted/labels/pt-tools.c with an error:

	  CC       pt-tools.lo
	In file included from pt-tools.c:114:
	pt-tools.c: In function 'pt_limit_lookup':
	pt-limit.gperf:78:1: error: function might be candidate for attribute 'pure' [-Werror=suggest-attribute=pure]
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

	"Pure" attribute is required for the function pt_limit_lookup() because
	it does not change program status other than its return value.

	To avoid the build failure, add _GL_ATTRIBUTE_PURE to the function.
	The attribute cannot be added in libparted/gperf/pt-limit.c because it
	is generated by gperf during the build process. Instead, add the
	attribute in libparted/gperf/pt-tools.c which includes the generated
	function.

2019-08-09  Shin'ichiro Kawasaki  <kawasaki@juno.dti.ne.jp>

	configure.ac: Check ABI against ABI version 2
	GCC 8 fails to compile libparted/labels/aix.c with an error:

	  CC       aix.lo
	cc1: error: -Wabi won't warn about anything [-Werror=abi]
	cc1: note: -Wabi warns about differences from the most up-to-date ABI, which is
	also used by default
	cc1: note: use e.g. -Wabi=11 to warn about changes from GCC 7
	cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
	make[4]: *** [Makefile:1250: aix.lo] Error 1

	To avoid the build failure, specify ABI version 2 to check ABI change
	from GCC 4.9.

2019-08-09  Brian C. Lane  <bcl@redhat.com>

	Adjust the gcc warnings to recognize FALLTHROUGH

	dos.c: Fix cast alignment error in maybe_FAT

	atari.c: Align the AtariRawTable on a 16bit boundary
	The casts to uint16_t need to know that this will be aligned. The struct is
	actually 512 bytes, so it normally does end up aligned. This just makes sure
	the compiler knows it and stops warning about the casts.

	configure.ac: Remove default -Werror flag
	Warnings as errors does not make sense with the current state of the
	codebase and it is making it difficult to do new releases.

	We should *show* the warnings, and handle them as time permits, but they
	should not block building a new release.

2019-07-15  Max Staudt  <max@enpas.org>

	libparted/fs/amiga/affs.c: Remove printf() to avoid confusion
	Currently, the affs code in libparted prints a debug line to stdout when
	an Amiga FFS partition is probed. This confuses tools that parse stdout.

	A prominent example is the partitioner (partman) in Debian's installer,
	which parses stdout from a tool (parted_devices) that uses libparted to
	scan the system's block devices. As of now, Debian cannot be installed
	on a typical Amiga:

	  https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2019/07/msg00015.html

	This patch removes this unexpected printf().

	Tests case for sigsegv when false nilfs2 superblock detected.

2019-04-09  Michael Small  <smallm@sdf.org>

	Avoid sigsegv in case 2nd nilfs2 superblock magic accidently found.
	1. is_valid_nilfs_sb: make sure the subtraction bytes - sumoff - 4
	won't give a negative number. That as the len argument to
	__efi_crc32() would give a very large number for the latter's for
	loop limit, since len is unsigned long.

	2. nilfs2_probe: Read and allocate enough sectors to hold a
	struct nilfs2_super_block.  is_valid_nilfs_sb() will be passing
	up to 1024 bytes to __efi_crc32(). If only one 512 byte sector
	had been allocated with alloca and read from disk that would cause
	reads off the the end of the stack even if bytes were more than
	sumoff - 4.

	Added support for Windows recovery partition (WINRE) on MBR
	Windows 10 uses a recovery partition which is sometimes marked with
	partition type 0x27 on MBR systems. It wasn't possible to handle such
	a partition with parted. Therefore the partition type PARTITION_MSFT_RECOVERY
	is now used properly also on MBR when the flag msftres is set.

	parted: Remove PED_ASSERT from ped_partition_set_name
	Asserts should only check logic, not wrap functions with side-effects.
	When compiled with --disable-debug this causes the name field of mkpart

	Read NVMe model names from sysfs
	parted currently shows the same generic model name for all NVMe devices:

	  # parted /dev/nvme0n1 -s print | grep Model
	  Model: NVMe Device (nvme)

	If the model information is available in sysfs, display that instead:

	If mkfs.udf is installed this will test to make sure that the filesystem
	is detected.

2018-10-16  Pali Rohár  <pali.rohar@gmail.com>

	libparted: Add support for MBR id, GPT GUID and detection of UDF filesystem
	This is needed for libparted based applications (like Gparted) to correctly
	choose MBR id and GPT GUID for UDF filesystem. MBR id for UDF is 0x07 and
	GPT GUID is Microsoft Basic Data, see why: https://serverfault.com/a/829172

	Without registering a new libparted fs code it is not possible to assign
	MBR id or GPT GUID.

	Detection of UDF filesystem is done by checking presence of UDF VSD (NSR02
	or NSR03 identifier) and UDF AVDP at expected locations (blocks 256, -257,
	-1, 512).

2018-10-16  Simon Xu  <xu.simon@oracle.com>

	Fix potential command line buffer overflow
	parted terminates with 'stack smashing detected' when fed with a long command
	line argument, and segfaults when the argument is long enough:

	root # /sbin/parted /dev/sda $(perl -e 'print "a"x265')
	*** stack smashing detected ***: /sbin/parted terminated
	...
	Aborted

	root # /sbin/parted /dev/sda $(perl -e 'print "a"x328')
	*** stack smashing detected ***: /sbin/parted terminated
	...
	Command History:
	Segmentation fault

	parted should be able to detect it and exit with error and usage messages.
	This also makes command line buffer overflow exploit more possible.  Fix it by
	adding length check in the condition of the for loop where command line
	arguments are copied.

	mkpart: Allow negative start value when FS-TYPE is not given
	The manual had long documented that negative values are
	allowed for both start and end values, but until now negative
	start values were rejected if FS-TYPE was not given.

	Example:

	  # parted --script -a optimal /dev/loop0 -- mklabel gpt mkpart primary ext4 -5MiB 100%
	  (succeeds)

	  # parted --script -a optimal /dev/loop0 -- mklabel gpt mkpart primary -5MiB 100%
	  parted: invalid token: -5MiB
	  Error: Expecting a file system type.

	This commit fixes the latter error.
	The issue was an insufficient lookahead in command line parsing,
	looking only for digits when skipping over FS-TYPE.
	The fix is including the minus '-' in the lookahead.

	Originally reported as Debian bug #880035:

	Fix make check
	Make check failed due to some warnings treated as errors.  One was

	It seems that this had previously been disabled but gcc has changed
	the flag from -Wmissing-noreturn to -Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn.  The
	recently added volser.c test also caused a few warnings when not

	parted/ui: remove unneccesary information of command line
	When some command fails, the information still exists in
	command_line buffer. When in command mode or interactive mode,
	if an interactive exception prompts, the remained information
	will be processed as option from user. This will raise some other
	information or even unexpected results. So before getting option
	input from user, clean the command line buffer.

	Example: When the disk label is invalid and user tries to make
		 new partition on the device with command like,
		 mkpart 0 50%. Then parted will raise an exception
		 telling an invalid disk label found and whether to correct it.
		 But at this time 0 as the input of mkpart will be
		 considered as the option input for the exception(yes/no).
		 So one more exception will raised with error information.

	clean the disk information when commands fail in interactive mode.
	parted always reads disk information to memory before any
	operations. The disk that user operates is actually
	a copy of real one in memory. When the information in memory
	is changed, it will commit the memory to device to update the
	disk information.

	Once the disk information is read, parted will never re-read it
	again unless another device is loaded or the device is re-read.
	Above work has been done in commit 7eac058 (parted: don't reload

	Each command of parted always commits the memory when it succeeds.

	parted: fix wrong error label jump in mkpart
	When the user makes a new partition, if parted fails to add the
	partition to disk, it jumps to wrong error label. In this
	situation, this new partition actually is not a node in disk
	data structure. But in the wrong error label, it pretends this
	is a node and removes it as a list node, leading to other
	partition in this disk deleted. This might lead to a memory leak.
	Because if there are other partitions, it just removes them from
	list without releasing the resource. And this also leads to different
	disk information between memory and device. This is confusing.

	But when the new partition is added to disk successfully and if
	any operations followed fail, this partition should be removed from
	disk and destroyed.

2016-12-22  Laurent Vivier  <laurent@vivier.eu>

	libparted: Fix MacOS boot support
	boot_region_length (or BootSize in the MacOS dialect) is the length
	of the driver code in the driver partition. This length is used
	to compute the checksum of the driver.

	libparted updates this value by setting the whole size of the partition
	without computing the checksum of the driver using this size.

	As the checksum is wrong, the driver is broken and cannot be loaded
	by the MacOS ROM, and thus the disk is not bootable anymore.

	Moreover, parted try to update the driver list and makes it disappear.

	As parted is not able to insert a driver in a partition,
	the driver is generally inserted by the Apple HD Tool,
	this patch removes the line updating the driver size.

	We also simplify the driver list scan and fix endianess use.

	This has been tested... and it works, now.

	I have updated a bootable disk with parted on x86_64 and
	then been able to boot it (again) on a Mac LC III.

	Use BLKSSZGET to get device sector size in _device_probe_geometry()

	HDIO_GETGEO ioctl does not return useful information.  The libparted
	code records hardware and bios reported geometry information, but all of
	that is largely unusable these days.  The information is used in the

	bios_geom fields to 0 and then use BLKSSZGET to capture the sector size.
	If that fails, try HDIO_GETGEO.  And if that fails, raise a warning and

	This problem showed up on Raspberry Pi devices where users were
	attempting to grow a partition to fill the SDHC card.  Using the

	tests: Use wait_for_dev_to_ functions

	It is best to use the wait_for_dev_to_appear_ and

	will loop and wait for up to 2 seconds for it to appear.

	libparted: Use read only when probing devices on linux (#1245144)
	When a device is opened for RW closing it can trigger other actions,
	like udev scanning it for partition changes. Use read only for the
	init_* methods and RW for actual changes to the device.

	This adds _device_open which takes mode flags as an argument and turns
	linux_open into a wrapper for it with RW_MODE.

	_device_open_ro is added to open the device with RD_MODE and increment
	the open_counter. This is used in the init_* functions.

	_device_close is a wrapper around linux_close that decrements the
	open_counter and is used in the init_* functions.

	All of these changes are self-contained with no external API changes.
	The only visible change in behavior is that when a new PedDevice is
	created the device is opened in RO_MODE instead of RW_MODE.

	libparted: mac: support sector size > 512 correctly
	This patch fixes several problems found when trying to do Apple
	Partition Map on a 4K-sector iPod. The problems happened because of
	unneeded conversion between physical sectors and 512-byte units.
	For devices with sector 512 the conversion did no harm, for others it did.

	List of problems (all are gone with the patch):

	* Partition in OS X, connect to Linux, run "parted <dev> print".
	  "Error: Can't have a partition outside the disk!" is shown.
	  Every partition is displayed 8 times (4k/512) bigger its real size.

	* Exec "mktable mac", connect to OS X.
	  The drive's partitioning scheme is not recognized.

	* mkpart creates partitions 8 times (4k/512) smaller than requested.

	tests: test loop labels
	Verify previous fixes to loop labels.

	libparted: don't trash filesystem when writing loop label
	If you deleted the fake partition on a loop label, loop_write() would write
	the loop signature to the device, zeroing out all other bytes in the first
	sector.  When the disk contained an ext[234] filesystem and was using 2k
	sectors, this would trash the super block residing in the 1-2kb part of the
	sector causing the disk to become unrecognized.  Instead, read the existing
	sector and only modify the first few bytes that contain the loop label.

	libparted: give correct partition device name on loop labels
	ped_partition_get_path() was returning "/dev/foo1" instead of
	"/dev/foo" on loop labels.  This caused gparted to run tools like mkfs on
	a device node that did not actually exist.

	partprobe: do not skip loop labels
	Partprobe was not syncing loop labels.  This resulted it failing to remove
	existing partitions when switching to a loop label.

	libparted: don't create partition on loop label
	The loop label represents an unpartitioned disk, but creates
	a dummy partition to represent the whole disk.  This dummy partition
	was actually being loaded into the kernel.  Don't do that.

2014-05-22  Phillip Susi  <psusi@ubuntu.com>

	libparted: fix loop labels to not vanish
	The loop label type was using the existence of a partition as a proxy for
	a filesystem being detected, and loop_write() would try to write a loop
	signature if there was no filesystem, and erase it if there was.  Because
	of this, creating a partition without writing a filesystem to it caused
	loop_write to erase the loop label.

	There seems to be no reason to bother erasing the loop label if it is still
	present along with a filesystem signature, so don't bother with this, and
	actually check to see if a filesystem is detected in the partition rather
	than using the existence of a partition to decide if writing the loop
	signature is needed.  Finally, since there is no way to preserve the
	existence of a partition with no filesystem in it, have loop_read() always
	create a partition, even if no filesystem is detected.

2014-05-22  Phillip Susi  <psusi@ubuntu.com>

	libparted: remove all old partitions, even if new label allows less
	We were limiting partition sync operations to the lesser number allowed
	by the device, or the label.  This meant that when creating a new label
	over an old label that had more partitions than the new one allows, the
	higher partitions would not be removed.  Use the greater of the two values
	for the remove pass, and the lesser for the add.

	libparted: remove old partitions *first* before adding new ones
	"libparted: avoid disturbing partitions" put the remove of the old
	partition in second pass.  If you simultaneously removed partitions 1
	and 2, and created a new partition #1 that overlapped the previous second
	partition, the sync would fail because it would try to create the new,
	larger partition #1 before removing the old partition #2.

	libparted: don't detect fat and ntfs boot sectors as dos MBR
	fat and ntfs boot sectors are very similar to an MBR so if you had one of
	these filesystems on an unpartitioned disk, parted detected them as a dos
	partition table.  Have the dos label code call the fat and ntfs filesystem
	probes and if they recognize the sector ( their tests are more stringent )
	then don't claim it as a dos label.

2014-05-22  Phillip Susi  <psusi@ubuntu.com>

	parted: don't reload partition table on every command
	gpt was using a static local variable to suppress repeatedly reporting
	an error if you chose to ignore it.  This is incorrect as the variable is
	global to all disks, and ignoring the error on one should not suppress its
	reporting on another.  Moving the flag to the PedDisk object made it
	effectively useless because parted was destroying the PedDisk and reloading
	the partition table on every command.

	Parted has been reworked to cache the PedDisk once loaded, and only discard
	it when changing disks, or creating a new disklabel.

	libparted: add support for implicit FBA DASD partitions
	Fixed Block Access (FBA) DASDs are mainframe-specific disk devices
	which are layed out as a sequence of 512-byte sectors. In contrast
	to ECKD DASDs, these disks do not require formatting and resemble
	the LBA layout of non-mainframe disks. Despite this resemblance,
	the Linux kernel applies special handling during partition detection
	for FBA DASDs, resulting in a single, immutable partition being
	reported.

	While actual FBA DASD hardware is no longer available, the z/VM
	hypervisor can simulate FBA DASD disks, backed by either ECKD or

	ui: switch to new-style readline typedef
	The CPPFunction typedef (among others) have been deprecated in favour of
	specific prototyped typedefs since readline 4.2 (circa 2001).

	bug#15591: [PATCH] libparted: handle i18n gpt partition names correctly
	gpt.c was simply truncating the UTF-16 characters stored
	in the partition name field to 8 bits.  This corrupted non

	strlist.c trying to convert the now invalid multi byte
	characters to wchar.

	GPT: add support for PReP GUID
	PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform) boot partition is the first partition used in
	PowerPC platform for containing the bootable kernel or bootloader. The firmware
	searches for this partition and jumps to it for booting. So far no GUID was
	specified for this partition type and hence booting from GPT disk was not
	supported on this platform. A new GUID 9e1a2d38-c612-4316-aa26-8b49521e5a8b for
	PReP partition is proposed to be included in GPT.

	Fix test compilation
	The tests were not being linked against libpthread but were using
	it, and recent versions of gcc refuse to implicitly pull it in.

	libparted: avoid disturbing partitions
	The partition sync logic was first removing all
	partitions, then trying to re-add them.  This resulted in many
	udev events triggering annoying behavior like auto mounting.
	Refactor the code to avoid removing and re-adding unmodified
	partitions.

	Revert "linux-commit: do not unnecessarily open partition device nodes"
	This reverts commit 2a6936fab4d4499a4b812dd330d3db50549029e0.  The commit
	disabled flushing the block buffer caches on the partition nodes to ensure
	cache consistency on 2.6 kernels, supposedly because this was no longer
	required.  It appears this was incorrect, and the caches DO still need
	flushed, otherwise a new fs written to the partition device does not show
	up in the disk device cache, causing parted to still identify the old fs.

	libparted: allow some common errors to be ignored
	Partitions that overlap or extend beyond the end of the disk are common
	errors that usually result in people having to use other tools to correct
	because parted refuses to operate when it sees them.  Change these errors
	to allow you to ignore them and use parted to correct the problem.

2013-11-23  Phillip Susi  <psusi@ubuntu.com>

	libparted: fix gpt end of disk handling
	There are two checks for problems with the end of disk.  The first checks
	to make sure that the backup gpt is actually at the end of the disk as it
	should be.  The second checks to see that the gpt's idea of where the disk
	ends is correct.  The handling of the backup gpt location was wrong because
	if you chose not to fix the error, then as soon as you made any changes the
	backup would be written to the end of the disk anyhow, only the previous
	backup would not be zeroed.

	This patch fixes the write path to put the backup gpt where the gpt says
	it goes, not where we think the disk ends.  This allows you to choose
	not to fix the problems, and the backup gpt will be written to the same
	place it was before, not the new end of disk.

2013-11-23  Phillip Susi  <psusi@ubuntu.com>

	libparted: handle logical partitions starting immediately after the EBR
	_blkpg_add_partition() set the length of the extended partition
	to 2 sectors to allow LILO to be installed there, beacuse the
	linux kernel does this.  If a logical partition used that second
	sector, adding it would fail beacuse of the overlap.  Now
	_blkpg_add_partition() will limit the length to only the first
	sector if the second is used by a logical partition.

	Previously parted did create the partition table, and after a
	reboot, the kernel would recognize the table, and happily create
	the extended partition as 2 sectors long, thus overlapping the
	logical partition, but when parted tried to recreate the same
	table with BLKPG, the kernel rightly rejected it.

	gpt: Revert small device commits
	The following commit broke the position of the LastUsableLBA:

	48f236f9: gpt: permit "mklabel gpt" on a 67-sector device

	It introduced an off by one error, leaving LastUsableLBA pointing to
	the first sector of the backup partition table instead.

	This effectively reverts that commit, as well as adjusting the subsequent
	commits to instead use 68 sectors as the minimum length.  I believe
	this is the minimum legal size as at 67 sectors, there is no valid
	value for FirstUsableLBA and LastUsableLBA.

	tests: t6003-dm-hide: don't hang on exception
	If the parted -l found any exceptions, it would print the prompt, which was
	redirected to the log, then hang waiting for input, which never came.  Use
	script mode to disable the prompts.

	parted: fix EOF and ctrl-c handling
	feof() seems to not detect EOF after readline() hits it, so parted went
	into an infinite loop prompting for input on EOF.  Change test to use the
	got_ctrl_c variable instead, which is set when readline hits EOF and
	returns NULL.  This also makes parted properly exit on ctrl-c.

	dos: improve MBR signature generation
	Using tv_usec in struct timeval from gettimeofday() doesn't provide

	while an unsigned 32-bit integer ranges between 0 and 4294967295.

	In FAT filesystem creation, parted already uses a better random

	disk, _disk_analyse_block_size could find reason to ask if it's ok to
	increase that to e.g., 2048.  Upon a positive reply, we would read 2048
	bytes into a 512-byte buffer.

	* libparted/labels/mac.c (mac_read): If needed, reallocate "buf"
	to accommodate a new, larger sector size.

	libparted: check PMBR before GPT partition table
	The UEFI spec requires that a valid GPT disk label have a PMBR
	partition. This moves the PMBR check to before the GPT check,
	exiting gpt_probe with a 0 if the PMBR is not valid.

	The previous behavior would cause problems in the following situation:
	 1. format a disk as GPT
	 2. re-format it as MSDOS using tools that don't understand GPT

	Subsequent operations with parted would then complain about the invalid
	PMBR, but would not allow the disk to be used as an msdos disk. This
	change causes parted to recognize the msdos partition table.

	libparted: avoid unwarranted failed assertion during mklabel
	This could happen when running "parted -s $dev mklabel $type" for
	nearly any $type, assuming the underlying disk's sector size is
	larger than 512 bytes.  This particular failure was noticed by
	running tests/t9050-partition-table-types.sh with a simulated
	sector size of 1024, as is done as part of a top-level "make check",
	but so far, this failure has shown up only on RHEL-6.2.
	That test attempts to exercise an ugly part of partition table
	creation: during creation, parted checks for an existing
	partition table by iterating through its list of known types and
	attempting to read the disk, looking for a preexisting table.
	Knowing this, the test takes all pairs of partition table types,
	<A,B> and first creates a type of type A, and then creates on top
	of that (erasing the original) a table of type B.
	* libparted/labels/mac.c (_disk_analyse_ghost_size): Remove bogus
	assertion.  If the number of the sector with a matching signature
	is too large, simply reject it by returning 0.

	libparted: gpt: rewrite even a 9-partition-entry table properly
	The vast majority of GPT partition tables have 128 PTEs (partition

	rewriting one (which can happen only in interactive mode), parted
	would fail to write the full PTE array whenever the PTE array size

	libparted: enforce dos partition limit
	The msdos partition table claimed a maximum partition count of 16
	but would allow you to go beyond that.  This resulted in the kernel
	not being informed of those partitions.  Corrected to enforce the
	limit.

	libparted: gpt: a smaller device need not render both headers invalid
	Putting a valid GPT-labeled image on a smaller device, (i.e., one that
	truncates the backup GPT header, but that does not impact the primary
	one) should not render the primary header invalid.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (_header_is_valid): Do *not* reject a header
	when its last_usable value is larger than the device length.
	This reverts part of commit v3.0-10-g99f9c6a, "gpt: don't abort for a
	truncated GPT-formatted device".  With this change, running parted in
	interactive mode with such an image/device combination will recognize
	that only the backup header is corrupt, and will offer to correct it.
	Before, it would report that both headers were corrupt.

	libparted: avoid the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl when possible
	We were using the long depreciated HDIO_GETGEO ioctl on the
	partition to get its start sector.  Use the new BLKPG_GET_PARTITION
	ioctl instead.  This allows for disks > 2TB and partitioned loop
	devices, which don't support HDIO_GETGEO.  As a fallback when
	BLKPG_GET_PARTITION fails or is not availible, try getting the
	values from sysfs, and finally use BLKGETSIZE64 and HDIO_GETGEO
	as a last resort.

	libparted: remove has_partitions check to allow loopback partitions
	Commit 1b766b69 added the _has_partitions function to check if a device
	was a loop device and if so, skip updating the kernel partition table
	because loop devices did not support partitions.  This function never
	worked anyway, and loop devices now (since linux 3.2) support
	partitions, so remove this crufty code.
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_has_partitions): Remove function and
	all uses.

	libparted: remove _loop_get_partition_range
	Commit 1eb0cc30 added support for loop devices to be partitioned,
	but it only enabled that support if the kernel parameter max_part
	was non zero.  This parameter just reserves minor numbers for
	partitions in the traditional sequence that hard disks used.
	When it is zero, it is still possible to add partitions, they
	just will get minor numbers from another pool.  Removing this
	check allows partitions to be used on loop devices even when the
	loop module was not loaded with the max_part argument.
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_loop_get_partition_range): Remove function
	and all uses.

	parted: mkpart: DWIM for IEC ending sector numbers like 2MiB and 9GiB
	Before, if the user specified start and end in mkpart command using
	IEC units, parted created a partition that starts and ends exactly on
	these positions. With such behavior, it is impossible to create
	partitions as follows: 1MiB-2MiB, 2MiB-3MiB - parted would complain
	that it cannot create the second partition, because the first one
	occupied sectors 2048-4096 and the second one sectors 4096-3072,
	so they would overlap at sector 4096.

	With this patch, if the user uses IEC units to specify end of the
	partition, parted creates the partition which ends one sector before
	the specified position.

	tests: TEST_ENVIRONMENT simplified and made more robust
	The test scripts in tests/ are shell scripts, so the current
	definition of TESTS_ENVIRONMENT, which adaptively run tests using
	either perl or the shell depending on their kind, is overkill.

	Moreover, this change is required in order for the testsuite to
	continue to work with the new testsuite harness that is planned
	to be introduced in Automake 1.12 (which, as of the writing date,
	is still under development and in late alpha state).

	linux: also detect "in-use" dmraid and scsi-Nth (N>=16) partitions
	Prior to this change, Parted would fail to detect any in-use
	partition on a dmraid disk, as well as any in-use partition
	numbered 16 or greater on a regular scsi disk.
	This was because assumptions were being made about the device node
	major/minor numbers and how they relate to the partition number.
	These assumptions are invalid for dmraid devices, and for normal
	disks with >= 16 partitions.
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_partition_get_part_dev): Remove function.
	(_partition_is_mounted): Rewrite to use _partition_is_mounted_by_path
	instead of _by_dev.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	tests: avoid subtle shell semantics bug
	This bug was causing some root-only tests to be mistakenly skipped.
	This bash command will always exit successfully,
	i.e., the "return 1" will never happen:
	  bash -c 'f(){ local f=$(false)||return 1; return 0; }; f'
	That's because the assignment always succeeds, and that success
	is what determines the return value, not the $(...) command.
	This is very counter-intuitive, sigh.
	The work-around is to separate the declaration and assignment, as in
	local f; f=$(...) || ...
	* tests/t-local.sh (new_sdX_): Do that.

	make parted "do what I say" with IEC start and end values like 5GiB
	In a command like this,
	  parted -s -- $dev mklabel gpt mkpart P-NAME 4MB -34s
	parted interprets the "4MB" as merely a suggestion for the starting
	sector number.  It uses half of the MB-units value as a "radius"
	about the sector containing byte 4,000,000, and it may choose some
	other more appropriate sector, based on partition table or alignment
	constraints within the range 3,500,000B..4,500,000B.
	Before, parted handled IEC units, i.e., KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.,
	with identically "helpful" sloppiness, of course honoring the
	power-of-two semantics.
	Now, however if you use IEC units, i.e., KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.,
	the "radius" is taken to be zero, so parted uses precisely
	whatever multiple of a power of two you've specified.
	Hence, adjusting the example above to use MiB, rather than "MB",
	  parted -s -- $dev mklabel gpt mkpart P-NAME 4MiB -34s
	With this change, that is equivalent to the following:
	  parted -s -- $dev mklabel gpt mkpart P-NAME 4194304B -34s
	I.e., it uses the sector containing precisely that byte, and
	does not perform any "extra" adjustment.
	* libparted/unit.c (is_power_of_2): New function.
	(ped_unit_parse_custom): Use it to avoid interpreting a large

	there are two ways it can end up zero: we lose the race when some other
	process pokes a 4-byte 0 into just the right location between when
	we write it and when we re-read the value we're about to divide by.
	Then there's the case that I encountered: using an old USB (8MB) key,
	mklabel gpt failed due to division by zero.  The device reported no
	failure when writing the initial header, yet when reading back that
	very same sector (also successful), parted got all 0 bytes.

	With this patch, parted prints all of this information (BIOS geometry

2011-02-23  Stephen Powell  <zlinuxman@wowway.com>

	s390: make DIAG driver work for FBA DASD with block size > 512
	In order to make the DIAG driver work for FBA DASD with a block
	size greater than 512, I had to make a rather awkward patch to
	C function vtoc_read_volume_label in libparted/labels/vtoc.c.
	The "right" logic would be "If this is an FBA DASD device
	using the DIAG driver, and the effective block size used by the
	DIAG driver is greater than 512, then do it this way.  Else,
	do it the normal way."  (Note that when using the FBA driver,
	the effective block size is always 512, regardless of the CMS
	logical block size stored in the volume label.  The DIAG driver,
	on the other hand, honors the CMS logical block size.)

	The problem is that the information needed to make that decision
	has not been provided to the routine (via the parameter list).
	So what I ended up doing is assuming the normal way, then if
	I don't find a recognized volume label header (VOL1, LNX1,
	or CMS1, in EBCDIC), then I assumed that it must be the special
	case.  So in the special case I end up doing an unnecessary
	read.  It's a kludge, but it works.

2011-02-23  Stephen Powell  <zlinuxman@wowway.com>

	s390: improve/correct DASD support
	The long title would be "corrections to partition size and location
	calculations for type 1 partitions for s390 dasd".

	This could be treated as two separate fixes, one to make corrections
	for LDL formatted disks and one to add support for CMS formatted
	disks.  I see CMS formatted disks as a variant of LDL formatted
	disks, with the additional twist that CMS formatted disks can
	be reserved or recomped, which LDL formatted disks cannot be.
	This affects the size and location of the partition.

	With these patches, parted matches the behavior of the Linux kernel
	in recognizing partitions on CMS- and LDL-formatted disks, as documented
	in the Linux kernel source code in routine fs/partitions/ibm.c.
	Calculation of the metadata has also been changed so that parted will
	show no free space on such a disk.  In some cases there are now two
	non-contiguous metadata extents: one at the beginning of the disk and
	one at the end.

	As before, parted only supports CKD DASD using the ECKD driver.
	FBA DASD and CKD DASD using the DIAG driver are still not supported.

	In my regression testing I have discovered some problems in the area
	of recognizing file system options.  However, since I can duplicate
	these errors on a version of parted which does not contain my changes,
	I have concluded that my changes did not cause this and therefore
	this is an unrelated bug.

	libparted: remove limits on loop labels
	There's no reason to impose any particular limit on loop labels, since
	they just represent a single large partition.  Sector counts over 2^32
	are needed for large RAID arrays.  Change the limit to 2^64 since that's

	libparted: avoid race in informing the kernel of partition table changes
	When sync'ing a partition table change using the latest
	code, sometimes we'd get an unwarranted failure like this:

	    Warning: Partition(s) 1 on /dev/sdd have been written, but we
	    have been unable to inform the kernel of the change, probably because
	    it/they are in use.  As a result, the old partition(s) will remain in
	    use.  You should reboot now before making further changes.

	To be precise, when running the partition-resizing root-only test
	in a loop:

	    for i in $(seq 240); do make -C tests check VERBOSE=yes \
	    TESTS=t3000-resize-fs.sh >& log.$i && printf . || echo $i $?; done

	I would typically see about 50% of them fail on a Fedora 13 system.
	It was obvious that this was due to a race condition when I found that
	modifying that tests' parted...resize invocation to go via strace changed
	the timing enough to make the test pass every time.

	The fix is to retry the partition-removal step upon any EBUSY failure,
	currently for up to 1 second (retrying up to 100 times, sleeping 10ms
	after each failure).

	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_disk_sync_part_table): Allocate "ok" using
	calloc, now that its initial values matter.
	Retry each removal upon EBUSY-failure.

	dos: always allow at least two sectors for extended boot record
	Unless specifically told otherwise, the Linux kernel considers extended
	boot records to be two sectors long, in order to "leave room for LILO".
	When using anything other than cylinder alignment, libparted was only
	allowing one sector in the minimum extended partition geometry, which in
	some situations (e.g. following Phillip Susi's patch to reintroduce
	BLKPG) could confuse the kernel into thinking that the EBR and the first
	logical partition overlapped.

2010-04-23  Phillip Susi  <psusi@cfl.rr.com>

	libparted: improve BLKPG error checking
	This patch cleans up the BLKPG code that the previous patch put back
	to perform proper error checking and in the event that some partitions
	are in use, they can not be modified in the running kernel using BLKPG.
	Warn the user that this is the case and advise them to reboot, just like
	we do when BLKRRPART fails for the same reason, unless the partition in
	question is unchanged.

	libparted: reenable use of BLKPG ioctls
	This patch effectively reverses commit 1d8f9bec which removed the code
	using the new BLKPG ioctls instead of the old BLKRRPART ioctl to update
	the in-kernel partition table.  The reason for this is because BLKRRPART
	fails if any partition on the disk is in use, but the BLKPG ioctls allow
	you to manipulate the other partitions on the disk without requiring a
	reboot.  Also BLKRRPART requires that the kernel understand the
	partition table on the disk, which may not always be the case.

	libparted: add test for /dev/mapper symlink issue
	Sometimes, libparted operates on device mapper files with a path of
	/dev/mapper/foo.  With newer lvm versions /dev/mapper/foo is a symlink
	to /dev/dm-#. However some storage administration programs (anaconda,
	for example) may do the following:
	1) Create a ped_device for /dev/mapper/foo
	2) ped_get_device resolves the symlink to /dev/dm-#, and the path
	   in the PedDevice struct points to /dev/dm-#
	3) The program does some things to lvm, causing the symlink to
	   point to a different /dev/dm-# node
	4) The program does something with the PedDevice, which results
	   in an operation on the wrong device

	Newer libparted versions do not suffer from this problem, as they
	do not canonicalize device names under /dev/mapper. This test checks
	for this bug.

	* libparted/tests/symlink.c: New test which tests for this issue.

	sun: initialize basic partition table fields
	libparted completely ignores basic fields (version, nparts and sanity)
	in the sun VTOC, then for example fdisk prints warnings for such
	partition table:

		# fdisk -lu /dev/sdb
		Detected sun disklabel with wrong version [0x00000000].
		Detected sun disklabel with wrong sanity [0x00000000].
		Detected sun disklabel with wrong num_partitions [0].

	It seems that the current libparted sun support follows old Linux
	kernel code, but the code was changed 3 years ago (see kernel commit
	3961bae0ac030a70ae2e0578270203889021f1a1).

	Note that the number of partitions (nparts) is optional for Linux
	kernel, but fdisk(8) strictly requires SUN_DISK_MAXPARTITIONS (=8)
	there. This patch sets nparts to SUN_DISK_MAXPARTITIONS rather then
	use a real number of partitions.

	linux: add wait time and retries to kernel partition reread
	Occasionally when using parted with newer GNU/Linux kernels (2.6.31)
	and udev (145), the kernel would fail to reread the partition table.
	This could lead to problems with subsequent actions such as formatting
	the partition.

	Basically this patch increases the retry_count, and adds one sleep(1)
	function call prior to the the last few ioctl() calls.

	This patch might not be a perfect solution to this problem of "failure
	to inform kernel of partition changes", but it does significantly
	reduce the likelihood of encountering the problem.

	parted: change warnings when initial constrained mkpart fails
	In do_mkpart we first try to create a partition using a constraint
	derived from the user input intersected with the devices alignment
	needs. And if that fails we try again without any constraint.

	However the warning given when this happens only takes into account
	the user not getting what he asked for, while the alignment might be
	a problem too (or even the only problem). So this patch adds a check
	to see if the user really did not get what he asked before giving that
	warning, and adds a new check + warning to see if the created partition
	is properly aligned.
	*parted/parted.c (do_mkpart,do_mkpartfs): change warnings when initial
	constrained mkpart fails.

	parted: honor --align option also in mkpartfs, resize and print cmds

	linux: handle incomplete topology information
	The topology information returned by libblkid is not always complete
	(as the kernel does not always have complete information).
	This patch makes the linux_get_*_alignment() alignment functions handle
	this. The algorithm used for linux_get_optimum_alignment is:
	1) Always use the reported aligment offset as offset
	2a)If optimal io size is present in the topology info use that as grain
	2b)If optimal io size is not present in topology info and aligment
	   offset is 0 and minimum io size is a power of 2, use the device.c
	   default optimal alignment (grain 1MiB).
	2c) If neither 2a and 2b, use the minimum io size, or if that is not
	   defined, use the physical sector size as grain (iow the minimum
	   alignment).
	The algorithm used for linux_get_minimum_alignment is:
	1) Always use the reported aligment offset as offset
	2) Use the minimum io size, or if that is not defined the physical
	   sector size as grain.
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (linux_get_*_alignment): Handle incomplete
	topology information.

	libparted: Give device_get_*_alignment sane defaults
	When the topology info is incomplete or non existent, return something
	more sensible than NULL (which ends up being interpreted as
	PedAlignmentAny in most cases). The default minimum alignment aligns to
	physical sector size, the default optimal alignment is 1 MiB, which is
	what vista and windows 7 do.
	* libparted/device.c (device_get_*_alignment): Add default aligments.
	* NEWS (New features): Mention it.

	linux: correct phys_sector_size setting
	1) Use the logical sector size as physical sector size instead of 512
	   when not compiled with libblkid support, this fixes problems
	   with logical sector size > physical sector size.
	2) blkid_topology_get_physical_sector_size() returns 0 when it fails
	   to determine the physical sector size, handle this.
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_device_set_sector_size): Correct
	phys_sector_size setting.

	ui: Do not truncate flag names when printing
	The partition_print_flags() function was truncating the flag names,
	but these are translated strings, and thus can contain multibyte
	characters. Truncating multibyte chars in a non multibyte aware way
	is not good and was causing issues when printing tables in Russian:
	http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543029

	Since the truncating does not seem to make sense at all this patch
	simply removes it (it was likely an attempt to stay within 80 chars
	when printing, but as one partition can have multiple flags set this
	won't work)

	ui: add --align command-line option to specify mkpart alignment
	The new --align command-line option can have the following values:
	none:     Use the minimum alignment allowed by the disk type
	cylinder: Align partitions to cylinders (the default)
	minimal: Use minimum alignment as given by the disk topology information
	optimal: Use optimum alignment as given by the disk topology information

	Note the "minimal" and "optimal" values will use layout information
	provided by the disk to align the logical partition table addresses
	to actual physical blocks on the disks.  The "minimal" value is the
	minimum aligment needed to align the partition properly to physical
	blocks, which avoids performance degradation.  Whereas the "optimum"
	alignment align's to a multiple of the physical block size in a way
	that guarantees optimal performance.

	The "minimal" and "optimal" values are useful only when parted is
	compiled with libblkid >= 2.17 and running on a kernel >= 2.6.31,
	otherwise they are equivalent to --align=none.

	libparted: add disk flag functions and PED_DISK_CYLINDER_ALIGNMENT flag
	Sometimes we want to be able to set flags at the disk level rather then
	at the parition level, to influence how new partitions will be created
	for example.  This patch adds functions to do this (modelled after the
	partition flag functions), and adds a PED_DISK_CYLINDER_ALIGNMENT flag.

	This flag (which defaults to true) controls if disk types for which
	cylinder alignment is optional do cylinder alignment when a new
	partition gets added. This flag is available for msdos and sun
	disklabels (for sun labels it only controls the aligning of the end of

	ped_disk_clobber: change semantics
	Why?  Because if we're going to clobber a partition table,
	it is wasteful and error prone to try to interpret as a partition
	table whatever existing data there may be.  It may be corrupt, or
	a mix of two or more types.  It is far cleaner just to zero out
	the key sectors.

	The previous mechanism was like this:
	for each partition table type, T,
	    # See if the device has a partition of type T.
	    # If so, run the partition-table-specific code to clear it.
	    if t->ops->probe (dev)
	      t->ops->clobber (dev)
	Instead, simply zero out the first few and last few sectors.
	Except for GPT, for which we exempt the first sector (the pMBR).
	In order to zero out even the bits DASD uses for its identifying
	strings, we have to clobber at least the 8.5KiB at the beginning
	of the disk, so round up to 9KiB.
	* libparted/disk.c: Include "labels/pt-tools.h".

	dasd: allow the use of a *regular* backing file
	Before this change, dasd partition tables had to be associated with
	very specialized block devices available only on IBM s390 systems.
	This made testing especially hard.  Not only did you need access
	to one of those relatively uncommon systems, but you also needed
	access to a spare block device.  In addition, many of Parted's
	tests may be run as a non-privileged user, using regular files,
	and those tests would fail when run on an s390.

	This change makes it so you may now write a DASD partition table
	to a regular backing file, just as you may with any other supported
	partition table type.  However, note that even now, DASD support
	is conditionally compiled and hence enabled only when compiling
	for an s390 target.

	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_device_set_sector_size) [__s390__]:
	Allow operation on a device of type PED_DEVICE_FILE, as well as
	those of type PED_DEVICE_DASD.
	* libparted/labels/fdasd.c: Include <parted/device.h>.
	(fdasd_get_geometry): Add a new "dev" parameter, required for
	dev-phys-sector_size, which is needed in order to initialize
	the "anc" structure without using the device-specific ioctls.
	When file descriptor "f" refers to a regular file, initialize
	"anc", "dasd_info", etc. from other sources (fstat and dev->).
	Update all callers to reflect added parameter.
	(fdasd_check_api_version): Skip ioctl-calling tests when "f" is
	a regular file.
	* include/parted/fdasd.h: Update fdasd_get_geometry prototype.
	* libparted/labels/dasd.c (dasd_probe): Also allow PED_DEVICE_FILE.
	(dasd_alloc_metadata): Initialize arch_specific->real_sector_size,
	which is used in calculating vtoc_end.

	There is no point in clearing what the primary header says is the

	at which points it gets completely re-initialized.

	Since the contents of the anchor saved during read does not get used
	anywhere else, this patch switches to using local anchor structs in
	dasd_read and dasd_write. This will also allow writing a significantly
	simpler duplicate implementation, then the one which is currently

	Implement get_partition_alignment DiskOp for all labels which need it
	Implement get_partition_alignment DiskOp for all labels which require
	an alignment with a grain_size != 1.

	libparted: add ped_disk_get_partition_alignment() function
	This functions get the alignment needed for partition boundaries on this disk.
	The returned alignment describes the alignment for the start sector of the
	partition, for all disklabel types which require alignment, except Sun
	disklabels, the end sector must be aligned too. To get the end sector
	alignment decrease the PedAlignment offset by 1.

	libparted: add ped_device_get_xxx_aligned_constraint() functions
	Add ped_device_get_minimal_aligned_constraint() and
	ped_device_get_optimal_aligned_constraint() functions to libparted.

	These functions can be used to get a device constraint taking alignment into
	account.

2009-11-01  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	ped_device_get_constraint: return constraint without alignment
	In libparted-1.9 ped_device_get_constraint() would always return a constraint
	without any start / end aligning (grain_size == 1). Now that we are starting to
	support disks with a physical sector size other then 512, the old
	ped_device_get_constraint() code may actually start returning constrains
	with alignment info with a grain_size != 1.

	Since this is a behavior change and since the old code does not take a possible
	alignment info into account, this patch removes the aligning code from
	ped_device_get_constraint(), so that its behavior is unchanged.

	This patch also updates the functions doxygen documentation to reflect what
	it has actually done all these years.

2009-10-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	gpt: header validity: also consider whether a PE array crc matches
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (check_PE_array_CRC): New function.
	(_header_is_valid): Use it to verify that partition entry array
	checksums match, too.
	Karel Zak noticed that this check was not being performed.
	* tests/t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh: Adapt to changed diagnostic.

	gpt: tweak interfaces to pass disk, not disk->dev
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c: required for upcoming CRC-checking function.

	gpt: don't ignore an improbable (1-in-2^32) failure
	pth_crc32 mapped failure to a crc32 value of 0.  If that happened
	to match the stored value, there would be no indication that there
	had been a malloc failure.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (pth_crc32): Change interface so we can
	distinguish failure from a CRC value of 0.
	Update all callers.
	(_generate_header): Now that we recognize pth_crc32 can fail,
	we must admit that its void-returning caller _generate_header
	may fail, too.  Return "int" and adjust *its* callers.

	gpt: factor out code that is about to be reused
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c: Include <errno.h>.
	(gpt_read_PE_array): New function, ...
	(gpt_read): ...factored out of this one.  Use it.

	gpt: don't dereference NULL upon OOM (pth_get_raw callers)
	Handle each case in which pth_get_raw may return NULL.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (pth_get_raw): Upon OOM error, return 0
	rather than dereferencing NULL.
	(gpt_write): Don't dereference NULL upon OOM error.
	(gpt_read): Yet another.

	gpt: don't dereference NULL upon OOM (in pth_get_raw)
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (pth_get_raw): Don't dereference NULL
	on out of memory error.

	gpt: remove dead store
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (pth_crc32): Remove useless initialization.

	gpt: make an internal function "const"-correct
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (_parse_header): Make "gpt" const.

	tests: convert t0280 to new test style.
	* tests/t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh: Convert to new test style.
	* tests/t-lib.sh: Source t-local.sh.

	tests: gpt: test for detection of corrupt backup partition header
	* tests/t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh: Corrupt the backup partition header's

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (gpt_read): Change diagnostic to say that
	the PTE CRC mismatch is in the primary table.
	* tests/t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh: Tweak diagnostic to match
	what the code now prints.

	gpt: also verify MyLBA when checking table validity
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (_header_is_valid): Add parameter, my_lba.
	(_read_header): Update caller.
	(_parse_header): Comment out this use of _header_is_valid
	in an assertion.

	gpt: clean up formatting of static initializers
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (NULL_IF_DISCOVER_ONLY): Define.
	(gpt_disk_ops): Use it to avoid in-decl #if directives.

2009-10-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	gpt.c: filter through indent --no-tabs...
	and manual fix-up to shorten long lines.
	Also, manually format the static initializers in e.g., gpt_disk_ops,
	since GNU indent botches that.

2009-10-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	gpt: add a comment
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (_header_is_valid): Add a comment to explain
	the new partition entry size limitation of UINT32_MAX/16.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	tests: use scsi_debug to test-for 4k-sector-specific bug
	* tests/t9010-big-sector.sh: New root-only test.
	Requires 2.6.31, and the scsi_debug module, /sys/block/... support
	and an upcoming version of libblkid.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add t9010-big-sector.sh.
	Thanks to Mike Snitzer for advice and for pointing me to similar
	code he wrote to test LVM.

	tests: begin the transition to coreutils' testing framework
	The existing testing framework makes it hard to diagnose test failures,
	so I'm switching to one that works better for me, from coreutils.
	* tests/t-lib.sh: New file.  Mostly from coreutils/tests/test-lib.sh.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TMPDIR): Update to pass more info to test scripts.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add t-lib.sh.

	linux: use libblkid to determine ->phys_sector_size
	Before this change, creating a memory-mapped disk on a fedora-based
	system running 2.6.31.1-56.fc12.x86_64 using this command:
	modprobe scsi_debug dev_size_mb=1025 sector_size=4096
	and then running "parted -s /dev/sdd mklabel gpt print"
	would mistakenly print "Sector size (logical/physical): 4096B/512B"
	The "512B" is what's wrong.  It should be "4096B".
	* configure.ac: Test for a new-enough blkid library.
	* libparted/Makefile.am (libparted_la_LIBADD): Add $(LIB_BLKID).
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (get_minimum_io_size): New function.
	(_device_set_sector_size): Use it.

	libparted: weaken a diagnostic
	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_kernel_reread_part_table): Give a more
	accurate diagnostic.  Reported by Curtis Gedak.

	gpt: verify CRC32 of partition table entry array, too
	The partition table entry array's CRC was not being verified at all.
	This adds an interim check.  The full-blown change required to make
	this implementation conform to the EFI spec will be more invasive.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (gpt_read): Check CRC of PTE array, too.
	* tests/t0280-gpt-corrupt.sh: New test for this.
	Reported by Karel Zak.

	doc: mention the "bios_grub" flag
	I don't like the idea of documenting this "flag setting" option,
	but it's been in the code for long enough now, and in actual use,
	that I feel obliged.  In the longer term, we'll probably deprecate
	it and instead add an interface to set a partition's type independent
	of mkpart's "type" argument.
	* doc/parted.texi (set): Mention bios_grub.

	tests: gpt: do not munge GPT data manually
	Otherwise, an upcoming change would cause this test to fail.
	* tests/t5000-tags.sh: Do not munge GPT data manually, since that
	does not update embedded CRCs, and thus renders it invalid.
	Set the attribute via "set 1 bios_grub on" instead.
	Also, use "name1" as the partition name, rather than the
	misleading "primary".
	Adjust diagnostics: the changes we make are no longer "manual."

	libparted: fix big-endian bug in gpt_get_max_supported_partition_count
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (gpt_get_max_supported_partition_count):
	Convert ->SizeOfPartitionEntry from little-endian to CPU endianness
	here, too.  This is along the same lines as commit d6e9b3bb, but
	with the difference that this code is not reachable via the
	command-line interface.

	* NEWS: Record release date.

	gpt: don't malfunction on big-endian systems
	Numerous GPT tests would fail when run on e.g., big-endian PPC.
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (gpt_read): Now that we use the
	SizeOfPartitionEntry member, be sure to convert from GPT's
	little-endian on-disk format to to CPU endianness.
	This bug was introduced via commit 14cce9b2, 2009-06-10, "gpt:
	fix gpt_read to read all of the partition entries correctly".
	* libparted/labels/gpt.c (_header_is_valid): Also convert it here.
	Add a test to ensure that the partition entry size is no larger
	than the slightly arbitrary UINT32_MAX/16.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	Remove an obsolete URL.  Do not encourage email to individuals.
	Update info-viewing instructions, provide the on-line doc URL.

2009-10-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: resize FAT and HFS file systems
	Since it looks like we're stuck with keeping at least FAT and HFS
	file-system resizing support in libparted, we have an obligation to
	exercise at least some of that functionality.  For now, I've limited
	this test to shrinking well-aligned partitions by a well-behaved
	amount.  Curtis Gedak helped come up with a usable test.

	* tests/t3000-resize-fs.sh: New file.
	Use starting partition offset that is on a cylinder boundary,
	and increase the partition size to be larger than 256 MiB.
	When resizing, choose the new size to be exactly one cylinder
	(8MiB) smaller than the original.

2009-10-06  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	ped_partition_busy: do not call the libparted exception handler
	Modify libparted/arch/linux.c _partition_get_part_dev() to not call
	_device_stat() but instead use stat directly, as _device_stat() calls
	the libparted exception handler, and we don't want this here, the only
	caller of _partition_get_part_dev() is _partition_is_mounted(), which
	in turn only gets called by linux_partition_is_busy(), and we don't
	want to "throw" exceptions from ped_partition_busy().

	This issue was noticed in combination with pyparted as used by
	anaconda, see: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/527035#c10

	* tests/test-lib.sh: Export the envvar setting,
	PARTED_SUPPRESS_FILE_SYSTEM_MANIPULATION_WARNING=1 to suppress
	those warnings while running the few remaining FS-related tests.

	maint: avoid false-positive NULL-deref warning from clang
	* parted/ui.c: Include <assert.h>.
	(command_line_get_disk): Add an assertion that command_line_get_device
	currently guarantees will always be true.  This placates clang regarding
	its sole NULL-deref warning.
	(command_line_get_device): Move declarations "down" to first use.

	build: use more gnulib modules for better POSIX compliance
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add modules exposed via
	make CFLAGS=-DGNULIB_POSIXCHECK 2>&1 \
	|perl -lne '/.* use gnulib module (\S+).*/ and print $1' \
	|sort |uniq -c|sort -nr
	Add these: close fsync lseek mkstemp strdup unlink

	* libparted/fs/ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (ext2_mkfs_create_lost_and_found_inode):
	Punt: suppress clang's (aka scan-build's) warning.
	* parted/parted.c (snap_to_boundaries): Remove a dead store.
	(do_mkpartfs): The apparent dead store to part_name exposed a real bug.
	In fact, it highlighted that while do_mkpart uses its "part_name"
	variable (and calls ped_partition_set_name), do_mkpartfs did not.
	(snap_to_boundaries): Remove dead store.
	* libparted/unit.c (parse_chs): Likewise, and a leak.

	* libparted/labels/dos.c (probe_partition_for_geom): Remove dead
	store in "can't happen" case.

	make PED_ASSERT handling sane: abort on false condition
	Upon a failed PED_ASSERT, Do not ask the interactive user if they want
	to continue.  This change will affect any code that expects to be able
	to continue after a failed PED_ASSERT condition.  However, such code is
	so fundamentally broken that this change is required.  If you require
	to be able to continue after a false condition, then the code must
	not use a macro named like PED_ASSERT.  This change was motivated by
	my desire to use the clang static analysis tool.  Without this change,
	there were over 300 mostly-false-positive reports.  With it, just 31,
	almost all legitimate.
	* libparted/debug.c (ped_assert): Remove first parameter.
	It is now tested via the macro.
	Now, this function always aborts, which helps clang understand.
	Do not ask the interactive user if s/he wants to continue.
	* include/parted/debug.h (PED_ASSERT): Test condition here,
	not in ped_assert.
	* libparted/disk.c (ped_disk_remove_partition): Remove the label
	that was used only upon failing PED_ASSERT.  Now that PED_ASSERT
	always aborts for a false condition, that would have been dead code.
	(ped_disk_new_fresh): Likewise.

	build: avoid a shadowing warning
	* libparted/fs/hfs/advfs_plus.c (hfsplus_get_empty_end): Rename local,

	or NTFS partition(s) is, by default, incorrectly set as "Microsoft
	Reserved Partition" type in GPT disks.  With this change, parted
	defaults to setting the FAT/NTFS Partitions partition type to
	Linux/Windows Basic Data Partition which will make them accessible
	in Mac OS X and Windows.

	Reported by hramrach@centrum.cz in <http://bugs.debian.org/441033>,
	with suggested change by Osamu Aoki <osamu@debian.org>.
	Keshav P R <skodabenz@rocketmail.com> wrote the above and prepared
	this patch.

	ui: do not initialize readline (which would output!) in --script mode
	Running parted with its --script (-s) option would, surprisingly,
	print a few control characters if TERM were set appropriately,
	and if readline and curses support were compiled in.
	This fixes it not to do that.
	* parted/parted.c (_init): Initialize readline support only after
	parsing command line options, so we can skip it in --script mode.
	* parted/ui.c (init_readline): New function.

	* tests/t1100-busy-label.sh: Use require_512_byte_sector_size_,
	so that we skip this test when in non-512-sector size mode.
	Remove the now-bogus line.
	Note: this test is not normally run.

	linux-commit: do not unnecessarily open partition device nodes
	After patching parted with my do-not-use-BLKPG patch, I started
	to get EBUSY errors on commit_to_os. Note this is not caused
	by the do-not-use-BLKPG patch, this was already happening, but
	parted was silently ignoring the errors (and the kernel was
	not notified of the changes, which is bad).  The error now
	actually gets reported.

	The problem turns out to be in libparted/arch/linux.c's
	_flush_cache function, which walks all the partitions of the
	disk and does BLKFLSBUF calls on them.  This causes the following:

	commit_to_os -> device_open -> fd = open /dev/sda ->
	_flush_cache -> for each /dev/sda# open, ioctl, close
	-> ioctl(fd, BLKRRPART) -> EBUSY

	What is happening here is that the:
	for each /dev/sda# open, ioctl, close

	Is causing udev change events for all the /dev/sda#
	nodes, which causes udev to call blkid on all these nodes
	(on systems which use DeviceKit), so blkid has /dev/sda# nodes
	open while BLKRRPART gets called on /dev/sda -> EBUSY.

	I've checked with two independend storage subsystem kernel
	developers, and /dev/sda and /dev/sda#, guarantee cache coherency
	now-a-days.  So there is no need to do this for 2.6, which also
	eliminates the need to call _flush_cache() on device open at all.

	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_have_kern26): New function.
	(_flush_cache): For linux kernels 2.6 and newer, don't flush
	partition devices.
	(linux_open): Skip _flush_cache on newer kernels here, too.

	linux-commit: remove the use of the BLKPG ioctl
	While testing partitionable mdraid I noticed that the kernels
	view of the partition table never changes even though I was successfully
	making commit_to_os() calls.

	This has let to me diving into libparted's commit_to_os() code for Linux
	and there are multiple issues hiding in there:

	1) Parted reads /sys/block/foo/range to determine how many partitions
	   the device type supports and then makes BLKPG ioctl's to update the
	   kernels view of the partition table for partitions which fall into
	   this range. However for example /sys/block/sda/range contains 16,
	   there are 2 issue with libparted using this number:
	   1) scsi major's only support 15 partitions, 1 of the range of 16
	      is reserved for the whole device, yet libparted will try
	      to notify the kernel about 16 partitions if present
	   2) If the major's partition minor's run out, the kernel will switch
	      to the mdp major for the other partitions, iow range no longer
	      limits the number of partitions.

	2) libparted assumes the user knows what he is doing, and will ignore
	   -ebusy errors for partitions, assuming that the user is smart enough
	   to only change unused partitions. Parted does this without checking
	   if the partitions which return ebusy actually are unchanged causing
	   REAL errors to get unreported (BAD, really really BAD)

	3) because of 1) libparted will only sync 1 partition on /dev/md#
	   devices (would be 0 if not for the of by 1 bug as all md#p#
	   partitions use the mdp major), and it fails to even do that without
	   reporting an error.

	###

	1) we can fix by simply not checking /sys/block/foo/range, but instead
	   just syncing max partitions.

	2) is more troublesome, we could just make -EBUSY n error,
	   but that may annoy / bug some users. OTOH in certain cases libparted
	   already falls back to BLKRRPART which will return EBUSY so users
	   should already be prepared to handle EBUSY

	3) Could be fixed by making libparted recognize mdraid as a device type
	   and except mdraid from using BLKPG, like it already is doing with
	   DASD, but it might be better to just get rid of using BLKPG all
	   together.  See below.

	An even bigger problem IMHO is the use of the BLKPG ioctl instead of
	BLKRRPART at all. What this does is tell the kernel parted's view
	of the partition table and make it use that, instead of telling
	the kernel to reread the partition table.  According to the parted
	sources this is done for the case where the kernel does not know
	the disklabel type. However as soon as the system is rebooted, the
	system will be using the kernel's view. So IMHO it would be much
	better to always use the kernels view and just always call BLKRRPART
	in commit_to_os(), this would solve all of the above issues, *and*
	make the way the system views the partition table consistent between
	just after running parted and after a reboot.

	I've attached a patch which removes the use of the BLKPG ioctl, notice
	that this also removes a lot of special case code and workarounds,
	which existence to me clearly indicates that using the BLKPG ioctl is
	a bad idea.

	* libparted/arch/linux.c (linux_disk_commit): Remove the use of the
	BLKPG ioctl.
	(_blkpg_add_partition, _blkpg_part_command, _blkpg_remove_partition):
	(_device_get_partition_range, _disk_sync_part_table, _have_blkpg):
	(_have_devfs): Remove functions thus rendered unused.

	tests: make two partition-related tests work for other sector sizes
	These two root-only tests would fail with the PARTED_SECTOR_SIZE envvar
	set to anything other than 512.  Now they also work for multiples.
	* tests/t4100-dvh-partition-limits.sh: Make sector-size agnostic.
	* tests/t4100-msdos-partition-limits.sh: Likewise.

	* libparted/labels/pt-tools.c (ptt_partition_max_start_len):
	Remove stray space in diagnostic that was causing the root-only

2009-08-28  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	parted: avoid unnecessary open/close on commit, and thus udev activity
	* libparted/disk.c (ped_disk_commit): Open/close the underlying file
	descriptor in this function, so that callees, ped_disk_commit_to_dev
	and ped_disk_commit_to_os do not each perform open/close syscalls.
	This saves an open/close pair, and thus avoids unneeded udev
	activity on Linux.

	Before this change, when calling commit() on a ped_disk, the
	following would happen:

	open /dev/sda
	write partition table
	close /dev/sda
	open /dev/sda
	ioctl (BLKRRPART)
	close /dev/sda

	This is rather inefficient, and causes 2 udev change events to be fired
	for /dev/sda (+ the change events from the BLKRRPART), causing all kind
	of scanning (blkid & friends) twice.

	This patch fixes things to only open the device once.

	Compensate for different behavior in t7000 test.
	When the t7000 test was first engineered the "n" did not appear in the
	output when testing mkpart & mkpartfs.  ATM, for an unknown reason,
	the "n" is being echoed in the resulting string causing test failure
	when compared with the errI string.  This patch attempts to make both
	behaviors (with and without the echoed "n") pass the test.

2009-07-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	mac clone: avoid failed assertion for sector size > 512
	* libparted/labels/mac.c (mac_duplicate): Do not assume that
	the first sector of the partition-map partition is "1".

	Running this: cd libparted/tests &&
	PARTED_SECTOR_SIZE=1024 CK_FORK=no valgrind ./label
	would result in a failed assertion:

	  ped_disk_remove_partition (...) at disk.c:1897
	  1897  PED_ASSERT (part->part_list == NULL, goto error);

	At first glance, it looked like the free(part) in
	mac_partition_destroy was the culprit.	And removing that free
	does indeed avoid the failed assertion.  However, not only does
	the name "mac_partition_destroy" imply/require the "free", but
	all other *_partition_destroy functions free their PART parameter,
	so removing this free statement cannot be the solution.

	Another possibility is that mac_duplicate's use of
	ped_disk_remove_partition is in error.  Removing it appears
	to solve the problem, but I don't know why that code is removing
	the partition-map partition manually, so can't safely remove
	such a thing.

	The real problem is that with >512-byte sectors, the "1" in this
	code from mac_duplicate is wrong:

	  partition_map = ped_disk_get_partition_by_sector (new_disk, 1);
	  PED_ASSERT (partition_map != NULL, return 0);
	  ped_disk_remove_partition (new_disk, partition_map);

	E.g., with 1024-byte sectors, the desired partition-map
	partition starts at sector 2, so the above gets the tiny
	metadata partition in the gap.  Calling ped_disk_remove_partition
	to remove a metadata partition provokes some nasty corruption.
	The desired first-sector number is old_mac_data->ghost_size, not "1".

2009-07-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	disable some file-system-related probe tests for sector size > 512
	These changes keep us from recognizing most file systems
	when the sector size is larger than 512.  However, for now (while
	concentrating on getting partition table support right) that's not
	a problem.  Besides, the code we're avoiding would inevitably make
	parted smash its stack.

	* libparted/fs/linux_swap/linux_swap.c (_generic_swap_probe): Fail
	the swap-file-system-recognizing test when sector size is not 512.
	* libparted/filesys.c (ped_file_system_probe_specific): Fail all
	fs-specific probe-related tests when sector size is not 512.
	* libparted/fs/jfs/jfs.c (jfs_probe): For now, don't even try to
	deal with larger sector size.
	* libparted/label.c: Skip tests of problematic file system types.

	Still working on making label support work.
	* libparted/fs/ext2/interface.c (_ext2_generic_probe): The call to

	parted-ui: ensure cmd-line buffer is empty before ped_exception_throw
	When ped_exception_throw requires input from the user and there are
	leftover strings in the command line, there is an "invalid token" error
	from parted.  This happens because the ped_exception expects some input
	that is, most likely, different from the leftover string(s).  To address
	this, one must make sure that all the argument strings are parsed before
	invoking any exception that requires input.

	* parted/parted.c (do_mklabel): Call command_line_get_disk_type call
	before the disk checks (_disk_warn_loss will call ped_exception_throw).
	* tests/t0000-basic.sh: Adjust, now that the output need not include
	the error message.

	entries, round up, not down, the number of sectors to read.
	(_header_is_valid): Check that the SizeOfPartitionEntry is sane.
	With minor adjustments by Joel Granados Moreno.

2009-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	rename all "support" parameters; avoid new compiler warnings
	Change each occurrence like this (which evokes a warning from gcc):
	-	return *supported = MAX_TOTAL_PART;
	to this:
	+	*max_n = MAX_TOTAL_PART;
	+	return true;

	I did it mostly mechanically:

	  cd libparted/labels &&
	    grep -l 'return .supported = ' *.c|xargs perl -ni \
	      -e '$m=/^\treturn \*supported( = .*;)/;' \
	      -e 'print $m ? "\t*max_n$1\n\treturn true;\n" : $_'
	  git grep -l 'int\* supported'|xargs perl -pi -e 's/int\* supported/int *max_n/'

	That got all but aix.c, which used different spacing: "int *supported",
	which I changed manually.  Then I updated all copyright dates.

2009-02-17  Petr Uzel  <petr.uzel@suse.cz>

	gpt: do not automatically "correct" a suspicious GPT partition table
	Previously, when parted was invoked on a disk with a GPT partition table
	and the backup GPT was not in the last sector of the disk, and even if
	the requested operation was just to print the partition table, parted
	would "repair" this automatically. This behavior is undesirable in the
	following situation:

	dm-raid on top of block device. The dm-raid is partitioned with GPT. If
	the dm-raid starts on the first block of underlying device (AFAIK this is
	the case with FastTrack controllers) and the user runs parted on the
	dm-raid, it will identify the physical device as being partitioned with
	GPT and see the backup GPT table not to be in the last sector of the
	physical device and thus move it to this location (which may lead to
	destruction of dm-raid metadata in case they are located at the end of
	physical device).

	This patch modifies parted's behavior to ignore fixing of backup GPT
	position by default.

	Add support for SD/MMC storage cards on Linux
	This patch adds a new SDMMC device type to represent SD/MMC
	cards.  There is nothing special about handling those devices,
	they are just standard block devices with different names.

	They use device major ID 179 and are usually called
	/dev/mmcblkN (where N is the card number) and the individual partitions
	/dev/mmcblkNpM (where M is the partition number).

	This patch was developed as part of an effort to make debian-installer
	support installation of Debian GNU/Linux on SD/MMC cards, as boot-from-SD
	is becoming a feature seen in mobile x86 devices.

	mkpart: Don't require a DVH partition name if it's guaranteed to fail.
	The mkpart command has an undocumented feature whereby it prompts for
	(interactive) or requires (-s) a partition name, *regardless* of whether
	it already knows the partition type (any thing but 'logical') is
	incompatible with a name.

	At first I was pissed and simply #if-0'd the offending code.
	But in case someone is actually relying on it, I've relented, and
	merely remove the prompt/requirement when the partition table type
	is "dvh" and the type of the partition in question is not "logical".

	Perform ChangeLog-creation here, rather than in bootstrap,
	so that the next merge will be less likely to clobber this parted-specific bit.

	Mention that we should be able to build with -fno-common.

	* bootstrap: Update from Coreutils, adapting to changes in gnulib.
	Among them: now gnulib uses git for version control.

	* libparted/tests/disk.c (START_TEST): Remove decl of unused local.

	Revert "History with undo and redo capabilities."
	This reverts commit 3bb8494e1ed5af0a48ad0211c3219e653167854f.

2007-08-08  David Cantrell  <dcantrel@mortise.boston.redhat.com>

	History with undo and redo capabilities.
	Author: Matt Davis <mattdavis@gmail.com>

	Here is a working version of the history with undo/redo capabilities.  The
	idea here was based on a talk with Otavio Salvador who mentioned the concepts
	from Vanni Brutto.  The idea being to capture all changes and only apply them
	all at once.  This protects the user from performing an unwanted change.  What
	I did was capture all disk modifications that are committed to disk, and put
	them in a list.  The history manager allows the list to be traversed linearly,
	so that a change can be undone, viewed in parted (print command), or reapplied
	again.  Nothing actually happens to the physical disk until the 'save' command
	is issued.

	Jim Meyering suggested that the functionality might be useful to libparted
	thus most of the functionality has been moved there.  The stdout displays
	(printf) are placed in parted.c as the library should not do any output
	printing on its own.

	Three commands were added:
	1) Undo : Undoes a disk modification
	2) Redo : Redoes the most recent 'undone' modification
	3) Save : Actually commits the list of non-undone modifications to disk

	I feel a bit more testing needs to be done, but I am happy with the results
	right now.

2007-08-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Revert "If we cannot create a new PedDisk for the device we're looking at, return NULL rather than the device path." The reverted change causes almost all tests to fail.
	This reverts commit a6f86144c0b5fd07c462e256bc7b54095c7b8e7a.

	Revert "Removed unused label (compiler warning)." The label *is* used.
	This reverts commit f4bc90ac22de605ad927d2d85ba468a16bf55ae7.

2007-07-31  David Cantrell  <dcantrel@mortise.boston.redhat.com>

	Fix block state checking for realocated blocks
	A busy block should be realocated and it's correct in

2007-07-10  Flavio Leitner  <flavio.leitner@gmail.com>

	Fix block number used when checking for state
	Hi there,

	The ext2_bread() returns a descriptor containing a
	pointer ->data representing the contents of 1 block.

	In ext2_block_relocate_grow(), it reads the block bitmap from
	a group descriptor representing a range of blocks:
	   bh = ext2_bread(fs, EXT2_GROUP_BLOCK_BITMAP(fs->gd[i]));

	Then it does:
	   k = EXT2_GROUP_INODE_TABLE(fs->gd[i]) + fs->inodeblocks + j;
	k is the absolute block number and then checks the state doing:
	if (bh->data[k>>3] & _bitmap[k&7])

	The k should be the offset inside of group descriptor and not
	the absolute block number. Example:
	. Block bitmap represents 512 blocks
	. Block absolute number is 1023.

	GrpDesc = Block absolute number / block bitmap size = 1
	bh = ext2_bread(fs, EXT2_GROUP_BLOCK_BITMAP(fs->gd[GrpDesc]))
	bh->data[] contains a bitmap of 512 blocks from 512-1024
	relative = absolute block number % block bitmap size
	relative = 1023/512 = 511

	The block state is in bitmap bh->data[relative>>3] & ...

	Avoid test failure on Linux-2.6.8 due to too small underlying file. Overwrite the label creating a 4KB file; 1KB was too small and would trigger the failure.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

	Work around test failures caused by inadequate libreadline.
	* configure.ac: Reject an inadequate libreadline5.0.
	* parted/ui.c (_readline) [!HAVE_LIBREADLINE]: Echo each
	just-read line, to be consistent with libreadline5.2.

	Avoid mklabel test failure with very small file on Linux-2.6.8.

2007-06-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix the mkfs final-block-group-too-short bug.
	mkfs would fail for certain sizes resulting in a final block-group
	that was too small to accommodate the minimum number of admin blocks.
	There was already work-around code for when a decremented "numgroups"
	was 1.  This change applies that work-around code for larger values of
	numgroups, too.  Also, there was an off-by-one error in the guard test
	that would allow a few too-small partition sizes to slip through and
	provoke the error (see tests/t2000-mkfs.sh for two examples).
	This change fixes that, too.

	Fix two "make check"-as-root failures. t1100-busy-label.sh: Remove extra copy of "o2" temporary file name. test-lib.sh (emit_superuser_warning): Exit successfully when run as root, too.

	Fix inconsistent prompt for file system type.
	* parted/parted.c (do_mkfs): Use a consistent prompt when asking
	for a file system type.

2007-06-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Add a test to record the current EXT2 mkpartfs failure for some sizes.
	Run this:

	    dev=F
	    dd if=/dev/null of=$dev bs=1 seek=20M
	    ./parted -s $dev mklabel gpt
	    ./parted -s $dev mkpartfs primary ext2 0 16796160B

	It fails with this diagnostic:

	    Error: Attempt to write sectors 32772-32773 outside of partition on /t/F.

	But if you choose a size that's one byte smaller, it works:

	    ./parted -s $dev mkpartfs primary ext2 0 16796159B

	The difference is in how ext2_mkfs_write_meta computes
	the number of block groups.  In the former case, it computes
	numgroups = 3.  In the latter, numgroups = 2.
	The trouble with the first case is that there isn't enough
	space for 3 full block groups in a file system of that size.
	Hence the eventual attempt to write beyond the initially-

	Avoid unnecessary writes in test scripts.
	This changes the tests to create sparse files for some test inputs
	rather than zero-filled non-sparse ones.  Doing this cuts more than 50% off
	the run time of "make check" in the tests/ directory.

2007-06-11  Matt Davis  <mattdavis9@gmail.com>

	Add a test for an ext2-resize failure.
	This patch is based on the change from Matt Davis:

	    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.parted.devel/1695/focus=1704

	Demonstrate an ext2-resize failure in parted-1.8.7, based on the report in
	http://parted.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/22

2007-06-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Turn off "DEBUG" in libparted/libparted.c, ... thus making it so that ped_malloc no longer initializes all just-allocated memory to all '1' bits.  Given the two bugs I've just fixed, this change is long overdue.

2007-06-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make "mklabel amiga" work also when DEBUG is not enabled.
	I turned off DEBUG and discovered test failures that its
	bogus always-initialize-malloc'd-memory policy had been hiding:

	(amiga_write): Initialize all of "->disk_specific" buffer.
	Avoid buffer overrun when initializing "TABLE".

2007-06-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	"mklabel bsd": don't read/write initialized memory, with DEBUG turned off I spent the first part of yesterday debugging the ext2-resize failure. As part of that, I turned off DEBUG and was surprised to see new failures in the label checks.  At least for label types "amiga" and "bsd", the implementation required that freshly-allocated memory be filled with all "1" bits, as was guaranteed by the default setting of
	#define DEBUG 1

	When I turned that off, bsd.c would read/write uninitialized memory, and
	rdb.c(amiga) would do more of the same and produce partition tables that
	it would then fail to recognize.

	Here's the fix for the bsd problems.
	I'll send the rdb/amiga ones separately, and once all tests pass
	without malloc-initialization-to-all-1's, I'll remove that, too.

	The bsd read-uninit bug was at bsd.c:341 (bsd_write), with this test:

		if (!bsd_specific->boot_code [0])
			_probe_and_add_boot_code (disk);

	that first byte was never initialized.
	So, I figured, that'll be easy.  Just initialize it.
	Wrong.  That wasn't enough, since then a part of that same 512-byte
	buffer (starting at offset 340) would be used uninitialized by
	a write syscall.

	FYI, the first failure was demonstrated like this:

	dev=f
	N=1M
	dd if=/dev/zero of=$dev bs=$N count=1 && valgrind ./parted -s $dev mklabel bsd

	Here's the first one:

	==20087== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
	==20087==    at 0x4429EE: bsd_write (bsd.c:341)

	Use read_sector, not ped_device_read.
	Adapt to changed type of "part_table".
	Now that "label" is malloc'd, be sure to free it before returning.
	(read_table): Likewise.

	Fix configure-with-nls vs. wchar.h/wcsdup problem differently. * parted/table.c: Include <config.h> *before* all other #include directives.  Remove explicit declaration of wcsdup.  Now, we'll get the one from <wchar.h>.

2007-05-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	On IRC, xeos reported test failures in t0000 and t2000 with diffs like this:
	  -/home/xeos/projects/parted/parted/.libs/lt-parted: invalid token: msdos
	  +parted: invalid token: msdos

	Here's the patch I expect to apply.
	It also removes an inter-part dependency by moving the creation
	of the "o2" temporary file into the test where it's used.

	Some of this duplication should be factored out, eventually...

2007-05-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Diagnose invalid command arguments.
	This started because I objected to parted failing with no diagnostic
	when given an invalid file system type:

	    $ /sbin/parted -s $dev mklabel loop mkpartfs hfsplus 0 1.4
	    WARNING: You are not superuser.  Watch out for permissions.
	    [Exit 1]

	With the changes below, it does this:

	    $ ./parted -s $dev mklabel loop mkpartfs hfsplus 0 1.4
	    ./parted: invalid token: hfsplus
	    [Exit 1]

	The following may look like a simple change, but looks are deceptive...
	For example, if you try to diagnose via ped_exception_throw instead
	of "error", you'll find that the mere fact of diagnosing the problem
	introduces new ones because of how the exception handler manipulates the
	global command line buffer containing the token we're complaining about.

	But this isn't library code, so using error() is fine.

		Diagnose invalid command arguments.
		When a command argument doesn't match the expected candidate values,
		parted would silently exit (in script mode) or simply act as if that
		value and any following ones had not been specified (in interactive
		mode).  With this change, it complains about the "invalid token",
		and in script mode (where there hasn't been a prompt to give context)
		sometimes tells what type of token it was expecting.
		* parted/ui.c: Include "error.h".
		(command_line_get_word): If the user's "token" wasn't a good enough
		match, give a diagnostic.  In script mode, return NULL so that the
		callers can give additional information.
		* tests/t2000-mkfs.sh: New test for the above.
		* tests/t0000-basic.sh: Expect the new diagnostic when "msdos" is
		treated as an unrecognized first token after "mklabel".  This happens
		when trying to label a disk that already has a label.
		* tests/t1100-busy-label.sh: Likewise.

2007-05-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use xmalloc and xrealloc, rather than unchecked malloc and realloc. * parted/table.c: Use gnulib's xmalloc and realloc. Remove anachronistic casts of malloc/realloc return value. Change "sizeof(type)" to safer "sizeof(*var)" (one of the former was wrong, but in a harmless way).

	Fix off-by-one error in previous change. * parted/strlist.c (str_list_print_wrap): Don't output a space unconditionally.

2007-05-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove a silly (and dangerous) function.
	This change has no effect, except in a low-memory condition,

	longer performs that malloc.

	* parted/strlist.c (get_spaces): Remove this function.
	Not only is it useless, but it also has an unchecked malloc.
	(str_list_print_wrap): Don't allocate and initialize a string
	just to print a sequence of N spaces.

2007-05-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Diagnose "ext2 FS too small" rather than triggering an assertion. * libparted/fs/ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (ext2_mkfs): An overlapping ext2 partition request could still lead to a bug: constraint-resolution code would produce a single-sector candidate "range", and that would cause the ext2 fs-creation code to misbehave.  Now, it properly detects and reports the FS as being too small. * tests/t3000-constraints.sh: New test for the above. * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add t3000-constraints.sh.

	Fix typo in privs-required test setup. * tests/test-lib.sh: Fix typo: s/\$parted/$parted_/.

2007-05-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't fail all tests when "." lacks O_DIRECT support.
	I often build tools on a tmpfs file system (it's faster), and
	found that parted tests always failed there.  That's because it tries
	to open the "device" (a file) with O_DIRECT, and at least the linux tmpfs
	driver always fails with EINVAL in that case.

	So here's a patch that makes it work.
	Since the test may require writing in a directory like /tmp,
	to which others typically have write access, it is particularly
	careful about security (see the mkdtemp script below), in case
	"make check" is run by e.g., root.

	Don't fail all tests when "." lacks O_DIRECT support.
	Before, running "make check" on a file system that doesn't support
	O_DIRECT (e.g. tmpfs), would always fail.  Now, it works, as long as
	the test machinery can find a writable directory in which open with
	O_DIRECT *does* work.
	* m4/o-direct.m4: New file.  Find a directory/FS with O_DIRECT support.
	* configure.ac: Use the new macro.
	* libparted/tests/t1000-label.sh: New file.  Wrap the binary, so
	it can take advantage of the code that finds O_DIRECT supporting FS.
	* tests/mkdtemp: New file.  Required, since when running tests as
	root, we may have to create a temporary directory in a directory
	like /tmp that's writable by others.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add mkdtemp.
	* tests/test-lib.sh: When creating test subdir, and setting up "trap",
	use the directory specified in $PARTED_USABLE_TEST_DIR.
	Don't set PATH here.  Now, that's done via the generated, and always-
	sourced, init.sh.  As a result, invoke parted via its full file name.

2007-05-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make all tests get their initialization from the same place. * tests/t2000-mkfs.sh: Get initialization via ". ./init.sh", not via ". ./test-lib.sh". * Makefile.maint (sc_test_init): New test, to ensure we stay consistent.

2007-05-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (init.sh): Make this generated file read-only.

	mkpartfs ext2 2 10 would erroneously report "file system too small" for some small (single-group) partitions.  It would also fail to report "file system too small" in some cases, and instead continue on to into inode-allocation code where it'd report "File system full!" * libparted/fs/ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (compute_block_counts): New function, factored out of... (ext2_mkfs): ...here.  Call compute_block_counts rather than open-coded it.  When decrementing numblocks, call compute_block_counts again, to recompute all of the derived values. Require at least 14 free blocks in a 16-inode-per-group partition. * tests/t1500-small-ext2.sh: New file.  Test for the above. * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add t1500-small-ext2.sh.

	Fix exception handling in mkpart and mkpartfs
	Parted mkpart and mkpartfs commands does:
	...
	   ped_exception_fetch_all();
	   if (!ped_disk_add_partition (disk, part, final_constraint)) {
		 ped_exception_leave_all();
	...
	   }
	...
	In mkpart if the ped_disk_add_partition() returns true it skips
	ped_exception_leave_all() leaving ex_fetch_count = 1.

	In mkpartfs if the ped_disk_add_partition() returns false it will
	call ped_exception_leave_all() leaving ex_fetch_count negative.

	The wrong count in ex_fetch_count will prevent next commands to
	correctly handle exceptions, failing to prompt users for example.

	Note: test script t2000-mkfs.sh improved to verify against this issue.

	Reverted my patch to configure.ac to remove -Wl,--as-needed from LDFLAGS when checking for libreadline.

2007-05-02  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	libreadline is a problematic library. Autoconf adds a block to the generated configure script that checks to see if we should be passing the --as-needed flag to ld(1). There are portability reasons this code exists (best I can figure), but it presents a problem when we scan for libreadline.
	libreadline specifically has unresolved symbols on at least Fedora and RHEL.  Why?  Well, the developer can choose to provide libtermcap, libncurses, or libncursesw (wide-char support) at compile time which all satisfy the curses API dependency that libreadline has.  When the parted configure script runs, it fails on readline because the --as-needed flag causes the linker to not include libncurses even though we already have that on the link line.

	My solution is to remove the --as-needed flag when we scan for libreadline and then later check for rl_completion_matches() in libreadline.

	* parted/parted.c (_parse_options): Upon failure, output diagnostic
	to stderr, not stdout.  Use "program_name" value, not literal "parted".

2007-04-20  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	[tests] New test for probing of disk labels.

2007-04-20  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	Revert "[libparted] dvh label fixes"
	This reverts commit dcf8e966abf997b9df69b1664c470ed2aa5c166b.

	[libparted] dvh label fixes

2007-04-19  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	[tests] Simplify test_clone_label removing the label reading test
	Since the test_create_label already tests the label reading we
	shouldn't redo it. It's always better to have simple tests so is much
	easier to find the bugs.

	[tests] Trivial coding style fixes around the tests code

2007-04-19  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	[tests] Add _test_exception_handler to fail every time an exception is raised
	Sometimes parts of code raises exceptions and this shouldn't happen on
	tests. To ensure we catch them a specific exception handler has been
	implemented.

	The handler usage is very easy. You just need to put the following
	code at testsuite main method:

	...
	        /* Fail when an exception is raised */
	        ped_exception_set_handler (_test_exception_handler);
	...

2007-04-19  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	[tests] New test for cloning of disk labels.

	[tests] Fix spacing around brackets and asterisks.

2007-04-18  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	Handle options independent of their order.
	Abort on any invalid option, and handle -v and -h first.

2007-04-18  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	[tests] Small refactoring on test_create_label
	 - Destroy the temporary device once the test has been finished,
	 - Use the _implemented_disk_label and _create_disk_label methods
	   to avoid code duplication.

2007-04-18  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	[tests] Implements _implemented_disk_label and _create_disk_label on common.[hc]
	 - _implemented_disk_label: returns 0 when we haven't yet implemented
	   this specific label and 1 otherwise;

	 - _create_disk_label: creates a disk label of a specific type on a
	   specific device;

2007-04-18  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	[tests] Ensure that we're able to read the just created disk label
	To ensure we're able to read the just created disk label we introduced a call
	ped_disk_new using the same loopback. This could detect bad label creating or
	probing detectiong mistakes.

2007-04-17  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	Indentation fixes in libparted/tests/.

2007-04-16  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	Show the update /etc/fstab message only when there has been a change to the disk. The message is now shorter and more direct.

2007-04-06  solsTiCe d'Hiver  <solsticed.hiver@laposte.net>

	change the variable named start to offset to be consistent with the doc

2007-04-05  solsTiCe d'Hiver  <solstice.dhiver@laposte.net>

	remove any trace of PED_PARTITION_PRIMARY which was deprecated a long time ago to use PED_PARTITION_NORMAL

2007-04-05  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	Added 'rescue', 'unit', and 'version' to the man page, plus some small edits.

2007-04-04  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@ossystems.com.br>

	Avoid segfault due a double free on reiserfs support (patch sent by Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org>)

2007-04-04  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	Make the wording of warning somewhat clearer.

2007-03-27  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	Tweak some help messages: change third person to imperative for consistency, add single quotes and remove letters for clarity

2007-03-19  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	Conditionalize the System Z stuff correctly.  We get headers installed on non-System Z platforms, but the code only compiles on that platform.

	Remove the COMPILE_FOR_S390 flag-setting stuff.  It wasn't correct anyway.  Take a kernel-style approach and check uname -m to see if we are on s390.  If so, we build for zSeries.  Otherwise we do not.

	Sleep for one second after uploading a file to ftp-upload.gnu.org.  Seems transactions need to be spaced out a bit otherwise the server will reject files.

	Fix for compile problems with gcc-4.1.2 as indicated here: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-parted/2007-03/msg00008.html

	Check for tgetent() in libtinfo as well as ncurses, curses, termcap, and termlib.

	Remove some unused variables, check the return values from fgets() and asprintf(), and remove the unused _dm_remove_map() function.

	Include vtoc.h for the format1_label_t typedef.

	Remove GNU make-specific things from po4a.mk.

2007-03-16  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	Install the libparted.pc file, not the libparted.pc.in file.

	More spec file template cleanups.

	Updated the release script to work with the new source layout.

2007-03-16  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	Fixed faulty information in README-hacking (Bison is not a maintainer tool for Parted), and Makefile.maint (every project has certain variations of it).

2007-03-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/getopt.c

2007-03-15  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	Prevented DASD specific headers and sources from being compiled/installed on non-s390 systems; and conditionally included fdasd.h in linux.h for s390 systems.

2007-03-15  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	Move static variable flagging little endian or not to journal.c.  We don't want static variables in general, but if they must exist, put them in a C file, not a header.
	Parameterize the little_endian flag for the macros in journal.h.

2007-03-13  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	Modernize the spec file template.

	Ignore more files.

	Patch from Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org> to add HFS+ resize support.

2007-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	hfs.c: Detect write failure. * libparted/fs/hfs/hfs.c (hfs_extract_file, hfs_extract_bitmap): (hfs_extract_mdb, hfsplus_extract_file, hfsplus_extract_vh): Fail when fclose fails for a written-to file handle.

2007-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

		aix.c: Avoid memory overrun.  Don't assume logical sector size <= 512B 	* libparted/labels/aix.c (struct AixLabel): Remove definition. 	(aix_label_magic_get, aix_label_magic_set): New functions. 	(read_sector): New function. 	(aix_probe): Rewrite not to use the above, and not a static buffer. 	(aix_clobber): Likewise. 	Also, rather than PED_ASSERT'ing that aix_probe returns 1, 	simply return 0 if aix_probe returns fails. 	(ped_disk_aix_init): Remove assertion, now that AixLabel is gone.

		Use PED_SECTOR_SIZE_DEFAULT not 512 	* libparted/arch/beos.c (beos_read, beos_write): 	* libparted/arch/linux.c (_device_get_length, _device_seek) 	(linux_read, linux_write, _blkpg_add_partition): 	* libparted/fs/fat/bootsector.c (fat_boot_sector_read): 	* libparted/labels/bsd.c (bsd_alloc): 	* libparted/labels/dos.c (probe_filesystem_for_geom): 	* libparted/labels/rdb.c (amiga_read):

	* parted/ui.c (non_interactive_mode): Plug a tiny leak. Exercise by running the following with a CD-ROM in the drive: valgrind --leak-check=full parted/parted /dev/cdrom print Before, we'd leak the 6-byte command: "print\0".

	linux.c: Avoid memory overrun.  Handle 2048-byte logical sectors. * libparted/arch/linux.c (linux_read): Allocate the right amount of space for the (potentially 2048-byte-long) sectors we're about to read.

2007-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't use deprecated mktemp, to avoid linker warning * libparted/tests/common.c (_create_disk): Rewrite to use mkstemp instead.

	* libparted/tests/label.c: Plug a trivial leak.

2007-03-07  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@sunflower.(none)>

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://rishi-guest@git.debian.org/git/parted/parted

This is ok, since the function is referenced only from this file. * include/parted/disk.h: Update their prototypes.

	Use <config.h> consistently, not "config.h". * Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): Remove sc_require_config_h, to enable the "make distcheck" test for this.

2007-03-06  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	start_pos is a PedSector, not a PedGeometry.

2007-03-06  David Cantrell  <dcantrel@mortise.boston.redhat.com>

	Preserve starting sector for primary NTFS 3.1 partitions (Windows Vista) when modifying the DOS disk label.  NTFS 3.1 partitions do not start on the 2nd head of the 1st cylinder at the beginning of the drive.

	Patched parted.8 man page to show partition names apply to GPT disk labels
	as well as Mac and PC98 disk labels.

2007-03-06  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	Replaced [f]printf with fput[c|s] in libparted/fs/ext2/ext2_block_relocator.c.

	Re-arranging .gitignore in alphabetical order.

	Defined a dummy '_dump_history' function in parted/ui.c when Readline is absent. Thanks to Jim Meyering for the suggestion.

	Added libparted/tests/label to .gitignore.

	Fixed parted/ui.c to incorporate signal handlers for systems lacking 'sigaction', 'SA_SIGINFO', and other constants in signal.h.

2007-03-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Undo part of the dos.c constification. * libparted/disk.c: The sole parameter of ped_disk_type_register and ped_disk_type_unregister must *not* be const. * libparted/labels/dos.c (msdos_disk_type): Likewise for the corresponding static struct in dos.c, since those functions modify the struct.  This didn't show up at compile time due to casts. * include/parted/disk.h: Update prototypes, too.

	Hide two unnecessarily-"extern" functions. * libparted/labels/mac.c (mac_alloc): Declare static. * libparted/labels/dos.c (raw_part_parse): Declare static.

	* libparted/labels/dos.c: Complete constification of this file. * libparted/disk.c (ped_disk_type_register): Make the sole parameter "const", so that caller's argument may be "const". (ped_disk_type_unregister): Likewise.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add partprobe/partprobe.c, now that it contains translatable strings.

	Make partprobe accept --help and --version options. Add long options: --no-update (same as existing -d), and --summary (same as existing -s). * partprobe/partprobe.c Include configmake.h, getopt.h, and NLS-related things. (main): Rewrite option handling. Along the way, fix a bug whereby "partprobe DEV1 DEV2 ... DEVN" would exit successfully whenever process_dev (DEVN) returns nonzero, even when that function fails for each of the preceding devices.

	Make clearfat accept --help and --version options. * debug/clearfat/clearfat.c (AUTHORS, PROGRAM_NAME): Define. Include gettext-related things. Include closeout.h. (usage): New function. (main): Set up for translations, use close_stdout. * bootstrap.conf: Add long-options, for clearfat. * debug/clearfat/Makefile.am: Use gnulib.

	* include/parted/disk.h (struct _PedDiskOps) [write]: Change parameter type to be "const".

	Begin making libparted/labels/*.c const-correct. For an introduction, see http://mail-archive.com/parted-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org/msg00930.html In particular, I've used a const-adding case in mac.c to work around the current, inconsistent semantics of mac_write.

	Avoid a libtool warning: libtool: link: warning: `-release' is ignored for convenience libraries * libparted/labels/Makefile.am (liblabels_la_LDFLAGS): Don't define.

	Make "make distcheck" work better. * Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): Skip sc_system_h_headers, too. * Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Don't depend on $(release_archive_dir).

2007-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid recursive "LIBS = ... $(LIBS)" assignments. * libparted/labels/Makefile.am (liblabels_la_LIBADD): Add $(INTLLIBS) here rather than via a recursive LIBS = ... $(LIBS) assignment. * libparted/fs/Makefile.am (libfs_la_LIBADD): Likewise.

2007-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* parted/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* partprobe/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	The above conversion caused a problem:
	* libparted/Makefile.am: Remove this recursive definition:
	LIBS = @INTLLIBS@ @LIBS@.  Once converted to LIBS = ...$(LIBS),
	GNU make would (rightly) fail, objecting to the recursive definition.
	(libparted_la_LIBADD): Instead, add $(INTLLIBS) here.

2007-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Enable the po-check rule.
	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): Remove po-check.

	Create 'm4' directory when generating the building system

2007-02-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Work with automake-1.10.
	I've just tried building parted from scratch (running ./autogen.sh
	after git-clone) and hit a couple of snags:

	Without aclocal's -I m4, ./autogen.sh produced this:

	  configure.ac:192: warning: macro `AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION' not found in library
	  configure.ac:193: warning: macro `AM_GNU_GETTEXT' not found in library
	  configure.ac:192: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION
	        If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
	        See the Autoconf documentation.

	With automake-1.10, I got this:

	    parted/Makefile.am:5: compiling `command.c' with per-target flags requires `AM_PROG_CC_C_O' in `configure.ac'

	Here's a patch that fixes those and also removes some trailing blanks.

2007-02-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Compile warning-free with "gcc -Wall -Wshadow".
	Hello,

	I find that keeping code warning-free (wrt gcc -Wall -Wshadow)
	makes it easier to avoid certain classes of bugs.

	Compiling with gcc -Wall -Wshadow evoked a few warnings
	on a Debian/unstable system.  Here are patches to fix those:

	* libparted/exception.c (default_handler): Rename parameter "ex"
	to "e", to avoid shadowing file-scoped global.
	* libparted/fs/linux_swap/linux_swap.c (_generic_swap_probe): Add a
	"can't happen" (with current callers) "default: goto error" clause
	in a switch to avoid a may-be-used-uninitialized warning.
	(_generic_swap_clobber): Likewise.
	* libparted/fs/hfs/reloc_plus.c (hfsplus_pack_free_space_from_block):
	Rename local variable "div" to "divisor", to avoid shadowing
	the function in <stdlib.h>.
	* libparted/fs/hfs/reloc.c (hfs_pack_free_space_from_block): Likewise.
	* libparted/fs/hfs/cache.c (hfsc_cache_add_extent): Rename parameter
	"index" to "ref_index" to avoid shadowing the <string.h> function.
	* libparted/labels/sun.c (sun_partition_enumerate): Rename local
	variable "i" to "j", to avoid shadowing another local.

2007-02-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	configure.ac: Add LOCALEDIR definition to CFLAGS only once.
	I noticed that there were two identical lines in configure.ac,
	adding the same LOCALEDIR definition to CFLAGS.
	This change removes the latter.

	* configure.ac: Add LOCALEDIR definition to CFLAGS only once.

2007-02-12  Riccardo Setti  <giskard@piton.asimov.bot>

	Added a pkgconfig file for libparted, adjusted Makefile.am and configure.ac for reflect the canges

	Fix the upload script to correctly reference the sig files.

	Remove ChangeLog, doc/mdate-sh, and doc/texinfo.tex since they are unmanaged files and get generated automatically at release time.

	Generate ChangeLog before running the autogen tools because we need a file called 'ChangeLog' to exist when running those tools.

	Pass git changelog through 'fold -s' to wrap long lines.

	Added the --enable-selinux switch to the configure script.  If set, it adds -lselinux and -lsepol to the list of libraries to link libparted with.  Bumped the version number to 1.9.9 since this is the edge branch.

	Rename all old ChangeLog files to ChangeLog.0.  Added code to the tarball_upload.sh script to generate a toplevel ChangeLog from the git changelog.

	Avoid warning about user permissions when using --version

	Readd the 'return 0;' to please GCC
	The commit d000de8f062ce070d5310f164ebf4f5ed26fcad0 included a
	compilation warning that makes sense when Parted is built without
	debugging. To solve the warning and ensure that when running without
	debugging we return a sinsible value I've reverted
	d000de8f062ce070d5310f164ebf4f5ed26fcad0 change and added a nice
	comment to avoid misunderstandings again.

2006-11-22  Anant  <anant@theghost.(none)>

	Fix loop in print_all, thanks to Debarshi Ray for the patch.

2006-11-20  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@debian.org>

	Remove useless 'return 0;' call
	Since PED_ASSERT will always be run, the return 0 is useless, hence
	removed.

	Remove useless semicolon from PED_ASSERT calls

2006-11-20  David Cantrell  <dcantrel@mortise.boston.redhat.com>

	Generate SHA-1 digests of the archive files and upload those along with the actual archive files.

2006-11-20  Otavio Salvador  <otavio@debian.org>

	Rework backtrace support
	While doing a deeply check about the backtrace support I found that
	-rdynamic is useless on CFLAGS and my previous change was wrong since
	it wasn't avoiding -rdynamic on LFLAGS if the running system missed
	the execinfo.h support. That would probably cause a build error on
	some systems.

2006-10-09  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	   * cs/geom.c (ped_geometry_read): Do not throw PED_EXCEPTION_ERROR here    if accessing sectors outside of partition boundary. Returning false    causes ped_geometry_check() to shift correctly anyway.  This occurs    on current Mac disklabels, among other systems.
	git-svn-id: svn://svn.debian.org/svn/parted/upstream/trunk@845 2d424fd7-7fe2-0310-af74-8bc65edeb173

	   * disk.c (ped_unregister_disk_type): Handle instances where disk_types    == NULL and the given type is not in the list of registered disk types    (from Debarshi Ray).
	git-svn-id: svn://svn.debian.org/svn/parted/upstream/trunk@844 2d424fd7-7fe2-0310-af74-8bc65edeb173

	       * parted.c (do_print): Define transport type list and display disk        model type and transport type (from Debarshi Ray).

2006-10-06  David Cantrell  <dcantrell@redhat.com>

	   * arch/linux.c: Change __GNU_SOURCE define to _GNU_SOURCE (only one    underscore at the beginning). Fixes problem with certain systems    not getting posix_memalign() defined during compilation.
	git-svn-id: svn://svn.debian.org/svn/parted/upstream/trunk@840 2d424fd7-7fe2-0310-af74-8bc65edeb173

	   * scripts/release/tarball_upload.sh: Since v1.0 directive files will    no longer be supported by ftp-upload.gnu.org after 2006, modified the    upload script to use the v1.1 format.
	git-svn-id: svn://svn.debian.org/svn/parted/upstream/trunk@839 2d424fd7-7fe2-0310-af74-8bc65edeb173

	   * scripts/release/tarball_upload.sh: Support the -a (or --alpha) switch    on the tarball upload script. This switch will upload the release to    alpha.gnu.org rather than ftp.gnu.org.
