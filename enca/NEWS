  * Debian package is back from death
  * failure to find external converter is now fatal
  - fixed build problems on FreeBSD (and probably other Unices)
  - libiconv is not used for `conversion to ASCII' since never does the
    Right Thing, whatever it is

    instead of ISO-8859-2/CRLF
  * --list languages by default prints English names, instead of ISO-639a
    codes, use -e or -r to get the old listing
  * if LC_CTYPE is something like en_US, more locale categories are examined
    to detect the language
  * cork charset was modified to contain \n, \r and \t in the same places as
    ASCII
  * some heuristics tuning

    charsets

    Lithuanian, Slovene
  + a new algorithm for 8bit-dense languages (cyrillics), the old one is used
    as a fallback
  * removed support for non-transitive iconv (such a thing should not exist)
