lcdproc-finish-nightly.sh sits on the sourceforge server located at lcdproc.sf.net

The other scripts (generate-nightlies.sh, make-nightly.sh & make-docs.sh) sit on a
local server and are run every night.
generate-nightlies.sh calls make-nightly.sh for each CVS branch,
and make-docs for each CVS branch for each documentation (user guide, admin guide).

At the time of writing the nightly tar balls are generated on a PC running Debian Linux
maintained by Guillaume Filion <guillaume@filion.org>
