Manual compilation (if autotools are not available):
$> gcc -o evtest evtest.c

Otherwise, run the following commands.

$> autoreconf -iv
$> ./configure --prefix=/usr 
$> make 
$> make install

Adjust the prefix as necessary, on most distributions /usr is fine.
evtest itself has no requirements other than the C compiler, if you need
evtest-capture, install the libxml-2.0 development files.
