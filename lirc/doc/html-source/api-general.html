The LIRC lib/ directory is indeed code used in various places. It offers
three views:
<ul type="disc">

   <li>External  applications uses the lirc_client.h header file and links to
     liblirc.so using -llirc. This is a mature, reasonably stable interface.
     See the <a href="lirc_client.html">client api</a> </li>

   <li>User space drivers includes the lirc_driver.h header and links to
     liblirc_driver.so using -llirc_driver. The other way around lirc
     accesses the driver as defined in the driver.h file (the driver
     structure). This interface is new and will probably need some time
     to stabilize. See the <a href="driver-api.html">driver api</a> </li>

   <li>Internal lirc  applications includes the lirc_private.h header file and
     links to liblirc_private.so using -llirc_private. This interface is
     subject to change without notice, and external applications are
     strongly adviced to not use it.</li>
</ul>
