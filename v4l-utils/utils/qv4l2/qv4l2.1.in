.SH DESCRIPTION
The qv4l2 tool is used to test video4linux capture and output devices, either video, vbi,
radio or swradio. This application can also serve as a generic video/TV viewer application
or as a video generator for video output devices.
.PP
However, it does not (yet) support compressed video streams other than MJPEG
.SH OPTIONS
