<H1>What is it</H1>

<P>This is perhaps the simplest and cheapest homebrew IR receiver
hardware for PC that can be built ever. It uses just one piece: a IR
module (any, more details on them can be found on lirc home page) and
a (very) optional diode.</P>

<H1>The schematics</H1>

<P>The basic idea is that the output of the IR module (somewhere in
the range from 0 to ~3-4V) can be limited by using the attenuator
built into every audio-card (also known as "mixer sliders"). For
purists it could be done by connecting a diode so that it shunts any
output voltages above ~0.6V (it is shown hashed on the schematics) but
this is not needed at all (I personally am not using the diode).</P>

<P>Here is the circuit:</P>

<P>And here is the pin-out of the TSOP1736 integrated circuit:</P>

<P>For other ICs I would recommend taking a look into the respective
data-sheet, they usually can be easily found on the net.</P>

<H1>Advantages</H1>

<P>Nevertheless to the simplicity of the circuit, it has
advantages. One of the advantages is that it eats very little CPU
time, because sampling the IR output is done by the sound card in
background, and you don't ever need high sampling rates nor sample
sizes: 8kHz 8-bit sampling is more than enough for our job.</P>

<P>Another advantage is that often you can avoid any external
connectors (like the one in the COM or LPT port) - you can use just
one of the lots of internal pin-connectors that every modern
motherboard has. So the device can be fully hidden inside the computer
case (except the receiver's photodiode, of course).</P>

<H1>Disadvantages</H1>

<P>Of course there are disadvantages too :-). One of the disadvantages
is that you need a power source. But usually there are so many power
pins on the motherboard that you always can find a spare +5V power
source. Consult your motherboard documentation for details.</P>

<P>Another potential disadvantage is that you need a duplex sound card,
e.g.  one that can play and record at one time. Most modern sound cards
are duplex, so most probably you won't have problems with this. Also
if you have just one sound card you won't be able to record sound and
do infrared control at the same time (if your card has just one
ADC).</P>

<H1>Usage</H1>

<P>To use this receiver, you will need to compile lirc with support
for the <B>audio-alsa</B> driver. For more information about the
driver and its usage you can refer to the <A
HREF="audio-alsa.html">LIRC documentation</A>.</P>
