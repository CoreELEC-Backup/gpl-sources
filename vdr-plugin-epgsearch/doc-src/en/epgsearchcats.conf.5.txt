=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchcats.conf> - Configuration of the additional EPG information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some EPG providers deliver additional EPG information like the type of
event, the video and audio format, cast,...

Using tvm2vdr or epg4vdr you can import this into vdr.  To use this
information with search timers one has to configure it with the file
epgsearchcats.conf in your plugins config directory.

Sample files for F<epgsearchcats.conf> are delivered with the plugin in
the directory 'conf'.

Simply copy the one that fits for you to your plugins config directory with
filename epgsearchcats.conf and then have a look to the search timers
edit menu (after a restart of VDR).

Since setting up a new F<epgsearchcats.conf> is a lot of work, I've added
a small tool 'createcats', that makes the biggest part of the job. It
should have been compiled with the plugin and exists in the sources
directory.

See C<createcats(1)> for information about how to use it.

B<Internals:> epgsearch scans the summary of an event for the category
name followed by ': ' for all categories that have a corresponding
value set in the search timer. The search is case sensitive regarding
the category name as also the value.

=head1 SYNTAX

 ID|category name(,format)|name in menu|values separated by ','(option)|searchmode(option)

 - 'ID' should be a unique positive integer
   (changing the id later on will force you to re-edit your search timers!)
 - 'category name' is the name as delivered by the EPG provider, e.g. 'Genre'
   you can optionally provide a format specifier for numeric values, e.g.
   Episode,%02i
 - 'name in menu' is the name displayed in epgsearch.
 - 'values' is an optional list of possible values
 - 'searchmode' specifies the search mode:
   text comparison:
    0  - the whole term must appear as substring
    1  - all single terms (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
         must exist as substrings. This is the default search mode.
    2  - at least one term (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
         must exist as substring.
    3  - matches exactly
    4  - regular expression
   numerical comparison:
    10 - less
    11 - less or equal
    12 - greater
    13 - greater or equal
    14 - equal
    15 - not equal
