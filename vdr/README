Yet another "set-top box"?
--------------------------

The "set-top boxes" available from commercial companies all have
one major drawback: they are not "open". This project's goal is
to build an "open" digital satellite receiver and timer controlled
video disk recorder, based upon open standards and freely available
driver software (of course, the hardware still has to be bought).

The on screen menu system is simple, but shall provide all the
possibilities necessary to perform timer controlled recording,
file management and even "on disk editing". The menus
of commercial set-top boxes usually are a lot more fancy than
the ones in this system, but here we have the full source code
and can modify the menus in whatever way desired.

If you actually use VDR, please add yourself to the "VDR User Counter"
