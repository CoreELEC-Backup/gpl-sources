Hi, these are issues that I unfortunately cannot resolve myself:

1. graphical menu written in GKT2, to be used in general connection with
    the outfile (-o) option.

2. for usage without script and outfile option:
    DVB monitoring demon helping the program to rewrite the PAT when the
    external player software has chosen a channel which is part of a
    new transponder.
    At the moment alevt hangs when the transponder is changed.
