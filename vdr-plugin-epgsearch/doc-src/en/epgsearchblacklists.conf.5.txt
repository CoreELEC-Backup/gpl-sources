=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchblacklists.conf> - Blacklist

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can create blacklists in epgsearch and use them in searchtimers.

A blacklist entry is like a normal searchtimer which is saved in the file
F<epgsearchblacklists.conf>.

While editing an searchtimer you can select one ore more blacklist entries.

=head2 USAGE

Searchtimer "Action" use blacklist "Damme".

Blacklist entry "Damme" searches "Damme"

First the searchtimer searches all films with "Action".

Then for each search result epgsearch will test if the result matches
against "Damme". If so, the result will be dismissed.

=head1 SYNTAX

This file uses the same syntax as F<epgsearch.conf> except that theres no <use as searchtimer> field.
So there's a shift by one field from this position. Because that, see C<epgsearch.conf(5)>.
