Files in this directory are for compiling with Microsoft Visual C.

The extract, driver, iso9660 and udf projects require Visual Studio 2010
or later.

To compile your own project, you will probably need to add the missing/
directory to your include path, as it provides stdint.h, inttypes.h and
unistd.h that provide some of the missing types required by libcdio.
