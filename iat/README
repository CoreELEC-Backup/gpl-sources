Iso9660 Analyzer Tool provides the conversion of any image format to an UDF/ISO for easy 
mounting in your favorite Operating System. The tool also permits the creation of TOC or CUE 
file descriptor to burn the image easily with your favorite burner on your favorite 
Operating System. If the image is not compliant with TOC or CUE, it should be converted 
to UDF/ISO format which can be mounted upon any Operating System.

file descriptor is a good option burn 1:1 original image. Iso9960 Analyzer Tool provides
