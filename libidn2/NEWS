* Version 2.3.0 (released 2019-11-14)

** Mitre has assigned CVE-2019-12290 which was fixed by
   the roundtrip feature introduced in 2.2.0 (commit 241e8f48)

** Update the data tables from Unicode 6.3.0 to Unicode 11.0

** Turn _idn2_punycode_encode, _idn2_punycode_decode
   into compat symbols (Fixes #74)


* Version 2.2.0 (released 2019-05-23)

** Perform A-Label roundtrip for lookup functions by default

** Stricter check of input to punycode decoder

** Fix punycode decoding with no ASCII chars but given delimiter

** Fix 'idn2 --no-tr64' (was a no-op)

** Allow _ as a basic code point in domain labels

** Fail building documentatino if 'ronn' isn't installed

** git tag changed to reflect https://semver.org/


* Version 2.1.1 (released 2019-02-08)

** Revert SONAME bump from release 2.1.0

** Fix NULL dereference in idn2_register_u8() and idn2_register_ul()

** Fix free of random value in idn2_to_ascii_4i()

** Improved fuzzer (which found the above issues)

** Fix printf() crash in test-lookup.c on Solaris

** Check for valid unicode input in punycode encoder

** Avoid excessive CPU usage in punycode encoding with
   large inputs

** Deprecate idn2_to_ascii_4i() in favor of idn2_to_ascii_4i2()

** Restrict output length of idn2_to_ascii_4i() to 63 bytes


* Version 2.1.0 (released 2019-01-04)

** Two exposed functions are no longer exposed:
   _idn2_punycode_encode() and _idn2_punycode_decode() which were
   meant to be used internally only. The output needs additional
   checks to be used safely.
   This is the reason to for the SONAME bump, just in case.

** Fix label length check for idn2_register_u8()

** Remove compiler warnings

** Use gnulib-python tool for bootstrapping if possible

** Improve build system (several small issues)

** Add missing error messages to idn2_strerror_name()

** Improve docs and remove typos

** Update gnulib


* Version 2.0.5 (released 2018-05-18)

** Switched the default library behavior to IDNA2008 as amended
   by TR#46 (non-transitional). That default behavior is enabled when
   no flags are specified to function calls. Applications can utilize the
   %IDN2_NO_TR46 flag to switch to the unamended IDNA2008. This is done in
   the interest of interoperability based on the fact that this is what application
   writers care about rather than strict compliance with a particular protocol.

** Fixed memleak in idn2_to_unicode_8zlz().

** Return error (IDN2_ICONV_FAIL) on charset conversion errors.

** Fixed issue with STD3 rules applying in non-transitional
   TR46 mode.

** idn2: added option --usestd3asciirules.


* Version 2.0.4 (released 2017-08-30)

** Fix integer overflow in bidi.c/_isBidi()

** Fix integer overflow in puny_decode.c/decode_digit()

** Improve docs

** Fix idna_free() to idn_free()

** Update fuzzer corpora


* Version 2.0.3 (released 2017-07-24) [beta]

** %IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES disabled by default.
 Previously we were eliminating non-STD3 characters from domain strings
 such as _443._tcp.example.com, or IPs 1.2.3.4/24 provided to libidn2
 functions. That was an unexpected regression for applications switching
 from libidn and thus it is no longer applied by default.
 Use %IDN2_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES to enable that behavior again.

** Fix several documentation issues

** Fix build issues

** Modernize gtk-doc build infrastructure.


* Version 2.0.2 (released 2017-04-27) [beta]

** Fix TR46 transitional mode

** Fix build issue on OSX

** Fix several documentation issues

* Version 2.0.1 (released 2017-04-22) [beta]

** idn2 utility now using IDNA2008 + TR46 by default

** Several doc fixes

* Version 2.0.0 (released 2017-03-29) [beta]

** Version numbering scheme changed

** Added to ASCII conversion functions corresponding to libidn1 functions:
- idn2_to_ascii_4i
- idn2_to_ascii_4z
- idn2_to_ascii_8z
- idn2_to_ascii_lz

** Added to unicode conversion functions corresponding to libidn1 functions:
- idn2_to_unicode_8z4z
- idn2_to_unicode_4z4z
- idn2_to_unicode_44i
- idn2_to_unicode_8z8z
- idn2_to_unicode_8zlz
- idn2_to_unicode_lzlz

** The idn2 manual page is generated from markdown text instead of utilizing
** help2man on the generated tool.

** Including idn2.h will provide libidn1 compatibility functions
** unless IDN2_SKIP_LIBIDN_COMPAT is defined. That allows converting
** applications from libidn1 (which offers IDNA2003) to libidn2 (which
** offers IDNA2008) by replacing idna.h to idn2.h in the applications'
** source.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

Reported by Ray Satiro <raysatiro@yahoo.com>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

Reported by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.5 (released 2011-05-18) [alpha]

** Fix NFC check to compare entire strings.
Some non-NFC strings were permitted when they should have been
rejected.  Reported by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org>.

** Self tests are not run under valgrind by default anymore.
Use --enable-valgrind-tests if you want to run self tests under
valgrind.  The reason was that there were too many false positives on
some platforms with valgrind issues in system libraries.  Self tests
are still run under valgrind by default when building from version
controlled sources.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.4 (released 2011-05-06) [alpha]

** libidn2: Fix domain name maximum size issue.
Domain names in string representation can be 254 characters long if
they end with a period, or 253 characters long if they don't end with
a period.  The code got this wrong and used 255 characters all the
time.  The documentation for the IDN2_DOMAIN_MAX_LENGTH constant is
improved.  We now pass two more of the IdnaTest.txt test vectors.
Reported by "Abdulrahman I. ALGhadir" <aghadir@citc.gov.sa> and
explanation from Markus Scherer <mscherer@google.com>.

** tests: Added several new Arabic test vectors.
From "Abdulrahman I. ALGhadir" <aghadir@citc.gov.sa>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.2 (released 2011-03-30) [alpha]

** Added command line tool "idn2".

** Added more test vectors from Unicode.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.1 (released 2011-03-29) [alpha]

** IDNA2008 Lookup+Register functions are now operational.
The implementation is still subject to changes, and thus no API/ABI
stability guarantees are made.  We are now inviting comments both on
the API (as before) but also on the actual behaviour.  Any unexpected
outputs are from here on considered as real bugs.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 0.0 (released 2011-03-09) [alpha]

** Initial draft release for public review of the API.
IDNA2008-Lookup is fully implemented except for 1) the optional
round-trip conversion part, and 2) the context rules are not
implemented.  IDNA2008-Register is not yet implemented.  The
implementation is known to be sub-optimal and ugly, please review the
interface and ignore the code!  Several changes are planned in the
internal implementation.
