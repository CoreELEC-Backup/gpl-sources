Installation Instructions for procps
====================================
Depending on what format you are using to get these files, you
might need to run the `autogen.sh` program to create the
configure script. If you have a configure script already then
you might not need it.

A typical installation would go something like
> ./autogen.sh
> ./configure
> make
> make install

The configure script has a lot of options, so please have a read
of `configure --help` to see what they are and what they are used
for.

Testing
-------
procps has a series of test scripts (and more are welcome if they
are repeatable). You will need to install DejaGNU to run it and
it is simply:

> make check
