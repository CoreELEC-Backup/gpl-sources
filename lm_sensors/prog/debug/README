This directory contains tools which may help with debugging lm_sensors.

find-driver
===========
If the 'sensors' program does not report useful values for certain hardware
monitoring inputs, the problem in most cases is not in lm_sensors. lm_sensors
only reads values exported by the Linux kernel. Finding the driver responsible
for exporting the particular hardware monitoring chip may help to diagnose
the problem further. It is possible that there is a bug in the driver, however
it is even more likely that the input is simply not used on your board.
Nonetheless, identifying the driver may help you identify the piece of hardware
that reports the bogus value.

This script finds the driver and kernel module responsible for exporting
a hardware monitoring chip in sysfs. It should be given the chip name (as
reported by the 'sensors' program) as argument. For example:

$ sensors
thinkpad-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
fan1:           0 RPM

$ ./find-driver thinkpad-isa-0000
Driver: thinkpad_hwmon
Module: thinkpad_acpi
