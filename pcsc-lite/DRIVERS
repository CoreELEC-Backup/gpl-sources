DRIVERS

To install USB drivers, download the driver from
http://musclecard.com/software.html and copy it to a temporary location.
After you have unarchived the files copy the directory to
/usr/local/pcsc/drivers/.  If the directory /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/
does not exist create it before copying the driver directory to it.

Example Mac OS X, Linux 2.4:

tar -xzvf driver.bundle-0.1.0.tar.gz
cp -r driver.bundle /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/
cd /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/driver.bundle
build or use Project Builder to build

The /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ directory should contain bundle directories only.
You must restart pcscd to use the new driver.


All OS's:

For non-USB users, you must edit the /etc/reader.conf file.
You can do this easily by running the installifd program in the utils/
directory of pcsc-lite.  Some newer drivers require you to specify 1 as the
port and then make a symlink from /dev/pcsc/1 to /dev/ttyS* so you can
enumerate your ports on any Unix without changing the driver.

Refer to the driver README for more information.
