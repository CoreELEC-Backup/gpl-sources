Installing DVBlast
==================

Compile the program with `make` and install with `make install`. Your
kernel must support DVB S2API which was merged in Linux 2.6.28 and released
on 24 Dec 2008.

DVBlast 3.X requires biTStream as a build dependancy, and libev as a runtime
dependancy.

To install biTStream, clone git repository and run `make install`.

    git clone git://git.videolan.org/bitstream.git
    cd bitstream
    make install

To install libev, download it from the home page:

    http://libev.schmorp.de

If you wish to support Deltacast ASI cards, you will first need to install
the Deltacast StreamMaster drivers and SDK, which are downloadable from the
Deltacast website (login required).
