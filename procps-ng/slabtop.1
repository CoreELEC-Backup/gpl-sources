.SH NAME
slabtop \- display kernel slab cache information in real time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B slabtop
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B slabtop
displays detailed kernel slab cache information in real time.  It displays a
listing of the top caches sorted by one of the listed sort criteria.  It also
displays a statistics header filled with slab layer information.
.SH OPTIONS
Normal invocation of
.B slabtop
does not require any options.  The behavior, however, can be fine-tuned by
specifying one or more of the following flags:
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delay\fR=\fIN\fR
Refresh the display every
.I n
in seconds.  By default,
.B slabtop
refreshes the display every three seconds.  To exit the program, hit
.BR q.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=\fIS\fR
Sort by \fIS\fR, where \fIS\fR is one of the sort criteria.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-once\fR
Display the output once and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage information and exit.
.SH SORT CRITERIA
The following are valid sort criteria used to sort the individual slab caches
and thereby determine what are the "top" slab caches to display.  The default
sort criteria is to sort by the number of objects ("o").
.PP
The sort criteria can also be changed while slabtop is running by pressing
the associated character.

.SH COMMANDS
.B slabtop
accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.  The following are
supported.  In the case of letters, both cases are accepted.
.PP
Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change the sort
routine. See the section
.BR "SORT CRITERIA" .
.TP
.BR <SPACEBAR>
Refresh the screen.

.BR Q
Quit the program.

.SH NOTES
Currently,
.B slabtop
requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically, a version 1.1 or later
.IR /proc/slabinfo ).
Kernel 2.2 should be supported in the future.
.PP
The slabtop statistic header is tracking how many bytes of slabs are being
used and is not a measure of physical memory.  The 'Slab' field in the
/proc/meminfo file is tracking information about used slab physical memory.
