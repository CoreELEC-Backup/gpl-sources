Installing biTStream
====================

Make install copies all top-level directories (except dvb-examples) in 
/usr/local/include/bitstream directory.

Install bitstream in its default location /usr/local/include/bitstream:

$> make install

Install bitstream in another location, eg: /usr/include/bitstream

$> make PREFIX=/usr install
