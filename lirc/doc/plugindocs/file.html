 <P>
  The file driver is a test tool. It can log recieved data to a disk file,
  and optionally also send data from another file.  </P>

 <P>
  The device argument is a file where the logged data will be saved. The
  saved data is printable, line like
<pre>
       space 50000
       pulse 850
       space 400
</pre>
  i. e., like presented by mode2(1).
<p>
  The driver supports the <code>set-infile</code> driver option, which can be
  set using lircd <i>-A/--driver-option</i> option. The infile is in the same
  format as the logged data.</p>
<p>
  The driver also supports the <code>send-space</code> option. This is used to
  send spaces longer than what can be represented with normal data, typical
  a gap. </p>
<p>Upon a request to send a LIRC_EOF pulse the driver will terminate the
running process using SIGUSR1.</p>
