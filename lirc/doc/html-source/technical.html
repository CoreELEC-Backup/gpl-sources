    <!-- Writing LIRC Drivers ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <hr/>
    <A NAME="drivers"></A>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Writing LIRC userspace drivers</H1>
    <P>
      Since 0.9.0 the lirc kernel drivers have been upstreamed to the
      kernel. So, while developing kernel drivers might be important
      from a LIRC perspective, it's no longer part of this project. </p>
    <p>
      Since 0.9.1, lirc user-space drivers (plugins) are loaded dynamically
      and compiled out-of-tree. Refer to the <a href="driver-api.html">
      Driver API</a>, the last chapter.
    </p>

    <!-- Writing LIRC Applications +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <hr/>
    <A NAME="applications"></A>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Writing Applications for LIRC</H1>
    <P>
      As LIRC is able to both receive and send IR commands there are
      two possible types of applications: programs that send IR
      commands liked <em>irsend</em> or programs that
      receive commands like <em>irexec</em>. </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, the lirc_client api can be used, supporting both
      sending and receiving of data. Refer to the
      <a href="../api-docs/html/index.html"> API documentation</a>
      and the <a href="lirc_client.html" > lirc_client api</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Another way is to connect directly to lircd's output socket and
      use the command interface. This is common in older code, often
      to send data (the ability to send data was added to the API
      0.9.2). The lircd socket interface is described in the
      <a href="lircd.html">lircd manpage</a>. Note that the routines
      in the client API can be used to send and receive arbitrary
      commands, not just to send IR data.</p>

    <A NAME="config"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Writing LIRC configuration tools</H1>

    <P>
      For the kernel-setup and related stuff such as available drivers
      and remotes there are a number of YAML files in the configs/
      directory. Here is also a large number of *.conf files which represents
      a configuration a user can choose. The formats are described in
      configs/README.</p>
    <p>
      The lirc-setup tool contains a self-contained module database.py
      which provides a python interface to these files.</p>
    <p>
      The information in the lircd.conf files can be parsed by the library
      routine <code>read_config()</code>.Here is also code to dump modified
      data to a new file.  However, this is only available in the lirc_private
      interface which by definition is unstable.</p>
    <p>
      The lircrc file is parsed using the <code>lirc_readconfig()</code> in
      the lirc_client interface. There is no code to write modified data to
      a new file.</p>

    <!-- New remotes++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Adding new remote controls</H1>
    <P>
      New remotes are added to the database according to the
      <a href="http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki">lirc-remotes wiki</a>.
      </p>
