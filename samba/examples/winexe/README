winexe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winexe/ is a project
based on Samba libraries from 2012. According to the winexe git
repository the last Samba commit winexe was updated to is 47bbf9886f0c
from November 6, 2012. As winexe uses unpublished Samba internal
libraries, it broke over time.

This is a port of the winexe functionality to more modern Samba
versions. It still uses internal APIs, but it being part of the tree
means that it is much easier to keep up to date.

The Windows service files were taken literally from the original
winexe from the sourceforge git. Andrzej Hajda chose GPLv3 only and
not GPLv3+. As GPL evolves very slowly, this should not be a practical
problem for quite some time.

To build it under Linux, you need mingw binaries on your build
system. Under Debian stretch, the package names are gcc-mingw-w64 and
friends.
