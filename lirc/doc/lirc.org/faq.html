                        Is my USB IrDA dongle supported by LIRC?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        No, it's technically not possible to use USB IrDA
                        dongles (as specified by the <A HREF="http://www.irda.org/">Infrared Data Association</A>) with LIRC. This does not apply to USB receivers in general.<BR>

                        The value of the resistor in the receiver circuit
                        is labeled as '4k7' Ohm. Is this 4.7 Ohm, 4.7 kOhm
                        or what?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        4k7 Ohm means 4700 Ohm. k is the abbreviation of

                        No, this won't work. But there is a project
                        working on a dedicated <A HREF="http://tusb3210.sourceforge.net">USB

                        I have a Hauppauge TV card. Can I use a different
                        remote control with this TV card except the
                        original Hauppauge remote control?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        The Hauppauge remote control uses the <A HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/rc-5/RC-5-extented">RC-5</A>
                        protocol. You should be able to use any TV remote
                        control that uses this protocol. Common brands
                        that use this protocol are Philips and
                        Marantz. A short description how to setup LIRC with an <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=200801192321.02652.tahoward%40nc.rr.com&forum_name=lirc-list">universal remote control</A> was posted on the mailing list.<BR>

                        How do the drivers for the home-brew receivers
                        work? Do they use polling?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        No, the serial port driver is fully interrupt
                        driven. On each edge of the IR signal the
                        interrupt handler is called and the time since the
                        last interrupt is calculated. As the parallel port
                        only generates interrupts on the rising edge of
                        the input signal, the parallel port driver uses
                        polling with the help of the hardware timer until
                        the signal becomes low again. As it is polling
                        only for microseconds this has no noticeable effect
                        on system performance.<BR>

                        port. Will this work?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        No, unless somebody writes a driver that merges
                        the functionality of the kernel serial port driver
                        and the lirc_serial driver. This is not
                        trivial.<BR>

                        Most of the time I have to push a button twice for

                        <BR>
                        <P>The remote control probably uses the RC-5,
                        RC-6 or RECS80 protocol, but irrecord wasn't
                        able to recognize this correctly.
                        </P>
                        <P>Try running <em>irrecord
                        remotes/generic/RC-5.conf</em>, <em>irrecord
                        remotes/generic/RC-6.conf</em> or <em>irrecord
                        remotes/generic/RECS80.conf</em>.  You will
                        find these template config files inside the
                        LIRC source package.  If this won't work read

                        Every time I press a button on my remote control
                        irw will show at least 5 events (or any other
                        number &gt; 1) independent of how short I try
                        pressing the button.<BR>
                        <P>In most cases this is the correct behavior. Many
                          remote controls send the same code multiple times
                          to make sure that at least one code comes through
                          to the receiver when you press a button for a
                          short time. The default .lircrc setup ignores
                          repeat events. If you want to use the button to do
                          things repeatedly when it is being hold down, like
                          e.g. increasing the volume or something similar,
                          you should use the <em>delay</em> token (will be
                          available in 0.7.0) in your .lircrc file.</P>
                        <P>You can identify such remotes by the fact that
                          irrecord usually will add a <em>min_repeat</em>
                          field for this remote control to the lircd.conf
                          config file.</P>
                        <P>If you want to suppress those repeats
                          already at lircd level, you can also add
                          <em>suppress_repeat x</em> to the
                          lircd.conf config file where <em>x</em> is
                          the number of repeats you want  to
                          suppress. This feature is available in lircd
                          since release 0.8.6.
