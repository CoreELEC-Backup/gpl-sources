How to contribute to megatools
==============================

If you want to contribute code to megatools, you can fork 
official git repository at:

    https://github.com/megous/megatools

To contribute bug reports and feature requests, use issue 
tracker at github:

    https://github.com/megous/megatools/issues


If you're developing application that uses libmega, be aware that
libmega API is still experimental, and may change in the future.
When megatools 2.0.0 will be released, libmega API will become
stable, and backward comaptibility will be properly maintained.

I will not be working on improving the tools themselves until I
finish the new libmega library.
