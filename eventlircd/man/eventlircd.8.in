.SH NAME
eventlircd \- an LIRC daemon with integrated udev support.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B eventlircd
.IR [ OPTION ]
.SH AVAILABILITY
Any GNU/Linux system with udev (at least version 136) and uinput (at least driver version 0.3) support.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBeventlircd\fR is an LIRC daemon for input devices that
supports multiple input devices at the same time,
discovers the input devices to be handled using udev,
maps keyboard shortcuts to single keys (e.g. ctrl+shift+KEY_B to KEY_REWIND), and
passes through mouse/joystick events.
.LP
A keyboard shortcut consists of
zero or more lock keys (capslock, numlock and scrolllock)
zero or more modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt and meta) and
one base key (non-lock and non-modifier key).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Print the help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the program version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the output message verbosity.
This option can appear up to three times.
The more often it appears, the more verbose the message output.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-foreground\fR
Run \fBeventlircd\fR in the foreground rather than in the background.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR \fB\-\-map=dir\fR
Look for device map files in directory \fBdirectory\fR rather than directory @EVMAP_DIR@.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-socket=socket\fR
Create the lircd socket \fBsocket\fR rather than lircd socket @LIRCD_SOCKET@.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fB\-\-mode=mode\fR
Create the lircd socket with mode \fBmode\fR rather than with mode 0666.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR \fB\-\-repeat-filter\fR
Filter input event repeats.
.IP
Because \fBeventlircd\fR can receive input from different input sources with different methods for limiting repeats,
the input event repeat rate may differ between inputs.
Therefore, in order to normalize the output repeat rate,
\fBeventlircd\fR uses time rather than count to filter the input event repeats.
.IP
Because users often want to use repeats to scroll both short and long on-screen lists,
the filtered repeat rate start slow and increases.
.IP
The time based repeat filtering provided by \fBeventlircd\fR replaces
the count based repeat filtering configured in the \fB.lircrc\fR file.
Therefore,
if you enable \fBeventlircd\fR's time based repeat filtering,
then you should disable \fB.lircrc\fR's count based repeat filtering.
That is, in the \fB.lircrc\fR file,
the value of \fBdelay\fR should be '0'
and the value of \fBrepeat\fR should be either '0' (ignore repeats) or '1' (allow repeats).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fB\-\-release=suffix\fR
Generate key release events with \fBsuffix\fR appended to the key name.
.SH UDEV DEVICE PROPERTIES
.LP
Udev communicates with eventlircd using udev device properties.
The following are the eventlircd specific udev device properties that can be set using ENV{} in udev rules.
.TP
\fBeventlircd_enable\fR
Used to ask \fBeventlircd\fR to handle the device.
If the value is "true", then \fBeventlircd\fR will attempt to handle the device.
.TP
\fBeventlircd_evmap\fR
Used to tell \fBeventlircd\fR the name of the map file to be used with this device.
If it is not set, then \fBeventlircd\fR will not perform any key mapping.
\fBeventlircd\fR assumes that the map file is located in the map directory. 
.TP
\fBeventlircd_remote\fR
Used to tell \fBeventlircd\fR the remote control name to use in the output \fBeventlircd\fR sends to the lircd socket.
If it is not set, then \fBeventlircd\fR will use "devinput" for the remote control name.
.SH FILES
.I @EVMAP_DIR@/*.evmap
.RS
The per-device key map files.
See \fBeventlircd.evmap (5)\fR for further details.
.RE
.I @includedir@/linux/input.h
.RS
The Linux input event device header file in which the key and button codes associated with the key event type are define.
.RE
.I @UDEV_DIR@/rules.d/98-eventlircd.rules.disabled
.RS
An example udev rules file for eventlircd.
.RE
.I @UDEV_DIR@/rules.d/98-lircd.rules.disabled
.RS
An example udev rules file for using lircd in conjuction with eventlircd.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH BUGS
.SH CAVEATS
.LP
\fBeventlircd\fR 
consumes all keys that it associates with
either a lock or modifier key token.
Therefore, when a key associated with
either a lock or modifier key token is received,
it is not forwarded to either the lircd socket or the mouse/joystick output device.
.LP
When a key press event is mapped to a value,
any intermediate key repeat events and the final key release event associated with the key press event
are mapped to the same value.
.LP
\fBeventlircd\fR 
supports a subset of the Linux input event types and event codes,
and silently discards the event types and codes that it does not support.
It supports 
It has complete support for
synchronization events (EV_SYN),
key/button events (EV_KEY),
relative axes events (EV_REL),
absolute axes events (EV_ABS)
It has partial support for LED events (EV_LED),
supporting the codes for capslock (LED_CAPSL), numlock (LED_NUML) and scrolllock (LED_SCROLLL).
All other Linux input event types and event codes are not supported.
