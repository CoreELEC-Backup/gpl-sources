     <!-- Dependencies +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <p>
    This chapter describes how to build and install LIRC. Note that LIRC
    is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
    just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
    other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
    dependencies, build and installation description found here.</p>
    <p>
    The ./configure script is the ultimate source as to what libraries
    and tools LIRC requires. The list here is not complete in any way,
    being focused on things to install before building.</p>

    <A NAME="dependencies"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dependencies</H1>

    <p>
      <b>Mandatory dependencies</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few mandatory dependencies, all of which
      packaged on most (all?) Linux distributions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Building directly from the git source tree requires
          <em>autoconf</em>,<em>automake</em> and
          <em>libtool</em>.</li>
      <li>Compilation and linking requires the GNU toolchain
          including <em>make</em>, <em>gcc</em>, <em>g++</em>
          and <em>ld</em>.</li>
      <li>python3 </li>
      <li>Building requires <em>pkg-config</em>.</li>
      <li>xsltproc </li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Optional dependencies</b></p>
     If these are missing, ./configure can cope with it and still
     build LIRC in a more or less limited way.
     <ul>
      <li>On linux building requires <em>modinfo</em>, often in the
          package kmod. Without modinfo, all kernel drivers are excluded
          from the build.</li>
      <li>On Linux building requires kernel headers, often in the
          kernel-headers package. Building without these is possible,
          but strongly discouraged (on linux).</li>
      <li>Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml at
          http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML. Some distributions includes a
          python3-yaml package. There is also a pypi package at
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML. Building without
          this is possible but not recommended.</li>
      <li>Generating the HTML manpages requires man2html. </li>
      <li>Generating the API documentation requires Doxygen. </li>
      <li>The Python bindings needs python 3.5+ to enable all
          functionality. Other python3 version should work, but
          will limit the python bindings API.</li>
      <li>The <em>lirc-setup</em> GUI configuration tool
          needs python3-gi and thus also the Gtk
          libs and icons. These are not required for the build, though. </li>
      <li>Building the X11 GUI tools like <em>irxevent</em> and
          <em>xmode2</em> requires the X11 header files. </li>
      <li> The audio drivers needs the alsa and portaudio libs
           (libraries and headers). </li>
       <li>
         The <em>ftdi</em> and <em>ftdix</em> drivers require libftdi from
         <a href="http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/">
         http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/</a></li>
     </ul>

    <A NAME="kernel"></A>
    <hr>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Kernel</H1>

    <P>
      As of 0.9.0+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building any kernel modules (as it used to).  </P>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).</P>
    <P>
      There are example and test kernel modules in the drivers/
      directory. None of these are required for regular LIRC use, but
      they are supposed to be helpful while testing or writing drivers.</P>

    <!-- Compiling +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="compile"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Compile and Install</H1>

    <P>
      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that
      that the build system is redesigned to always build all drivers.
      The former setup.sh script is dropped in favor of a standard
      ./configure, make, make install sequence.
    </P>
    <p>
      When building directly from git, a first required step to
      create ./configure and some other files is </p>
<pre>
           ./autogen.sh
</pre>
      Whether using git sources or just using a distributed tarball, the
      next steps are the canonical
<pre>
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        When running the configure script, please pay attention at its
        output.  Specifically, at the very end it prints a list of
        the enabled functionality.</li>
      <li>
        Running configure without options will install lirc in /usr/local
        according to GNU standards. However, many examples in this manual
        as well as other documentation are assuming that ./configure ran
        with the <em>--prefix=/usr</em> option, installing in /etc/lirc,
        /usr/bin etc.</li>
      <li>
        When cross-compiling, the configure script cannot use the defaults
        determined from the build host. Hence, cross-compiling requires a
        close look to the <i>./configure --help</i> output which have some
        hints for this.</li>
      <li>
        The build system supports VPATH builds which does not
        clutter the source tree. To use this do something like:
<pre>
            mkdir _build; cd _build;
            ../configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <A NAME="check"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Checking the build</H1>

     Since the dynamic drivers are not linked during the build, it's
     recommended to check that the expected drivers are built and can
     be loaded using
<pre>
             cd tools; ./lirc-lsplugins -U ../plugins/.libs
</pre>
     <p>
     Is some cases, lirc-lsplugins will crash on missing libraries e. g.,
     <em>liblirc.so.0</em>. If so, you need to add the path where lirc
     installs it's libraries (by default, /usr/local/lib) to the runtime
     linker path. Refer to generic ld.so(1) documentation.</p>
     <p>
     With working paths lirc-lsplugins will create a list of all drivers
     available, and also possible link errors not revealed during the build.
     <em>lirc-lsplugins</em> has a <em> -h</em> option providing help, and
     <em> nroff -man ../doc/man/lirc-lsplugins.1 | more </em>
     provides more complete info.</p>
     <p>
     The test/ directory contains some (but too few) unit tests. Compiling
     these requires the <em>cppunit</em> library from
     https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/cppunit. <em>cppunit</em> is
     packaged in most linux distribtutions. With this in place,
     do:</p>
     <pre>
         $ cd test
         $ make
         $ ./run-tests
     </pre>
     <p>
     From 0.10.0, the python-pkg has some traditional unittests. These
     tests requires the <em>socat</em> and <em>expect</em> packages, both of
     which packaged for major linux distributions.  The python version
     needs to be 3.5+. To invoke: </p>
     <pre>
          $ cd python-pkg/tests
          $ python3 -m unittest discover
     </pre>

    <A NAME="configuration"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Configuration</H1>

    <p>
      Formerly, lirc was configured during build where the setup.sh script
      was used to select driver, configuration file, etc. Also, there was
      little support for starting and running the services from boot. From
      0.9.1+ the configuration is instead done after the build. The
      configuration steps for the main lircd program involves:
    <ul>
        <li> In some cases e. g., serial devices setting up kernel module
             options in /etc/modprobe.d or using udev rules. </li>
        <li> Selecting the driver and kernel device for your capture
             device.</li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file for your remote.</li>
        <li> Configuring and using systemd to run the services. </li>
        <li> Creating lircrc files for your applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is described in the <a href="configuration-guide.html">
      configuration guide</a>.</p>

     The <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS</a> file  describes the changes since last
     version. Normally, upgrading from a previous version should not be too
     painful. However, if you have to update a really old version it's probably
     better to make a fresh install.
