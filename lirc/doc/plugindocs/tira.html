    <P>
      Ira/Tira devices can operate in two recording modes:
    <ul>
      <li>returning a 6 bytes length encoded information about the RC
        signal or</li>
      <li>returning a time table of the signal / space lengths in
        microseconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The purpose of 6 byte mode is controlling your PC with the remote
    control while the timing mode is used to record reproducible IR
    signals to control other devices (TV, amplifier, etc.).</p>
    <P>
      LIRC includes two separate drivers for the Tira: <em>tira</em>
      uses 6 bytes mode and supports transmitting of IR signals,
      <em>tira_raw</em> uses timing mode. The hardware does not
      support transmit in timing mode. If you want to transmit infra-red
      signals with the Tira this means that you need to use the
      <em>tira_raw</em> driver to create a config file with irrecord
      and later have to use this config file to transmit with the
      <em>tira</em> driver. But you need to create another config file
      even for the same remote in 6 byte mode if you want to receive
      from any remote because the config files created are not
      compatible between the two modes of operation.
