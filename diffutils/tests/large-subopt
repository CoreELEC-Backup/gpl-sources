# This test is expected to fail at least with diffutils-3.6.
# Demonstrate how diff can produce suboptimal output.
# With these two files, diff -u prints output including this:
# -2
# +L: 361
# +L: 361
# +2
# The trouble is that "2" line that is both added and removed.
# This smaller patch could induce the same change:
# +L: 361
# +L: 361
