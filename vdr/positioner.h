/// A steerable satellite dish generally points to the south on the northern hemisphere,
/// and to the north on the southern hemisphere (unless you're located directly on the
/// equator, in which case the general direction is "up"). Therefore, moving the dish
/// "east" or "west" means something different on either hemisphere. From the local dish
/// motor's point of view, it makes more sense to speak of turning the dish "left" or
/// "right", which is independent of the actual hemisphere the dish is located in.
/// In the cPositioner class context, when a dish on the northern hemisphere moves "east",
/// it is considered to be moving "left". Imagine standing behind the dish and looking
/// towards the satellites, and clearly "east" is "left". On the southern hemisphere
/// the same move to the "left" would go to the "west". So on the hardware level it is
/// clear what "left" and "right" means. The user interface may present different labels
/// to the viewer, depending on the hemisphere the dish is on.
/// All angles in this context are given in "degrees * 10", which allows for an angular
/// resolution of 0.1 degrees.
