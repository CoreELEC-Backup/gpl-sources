.SH NAME
dvbv5-scan \- DVBv5 tool for frequency scanning
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvbv5-scan
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIinitial-file\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
dvbv5-scan is a command line frequency scanning tool for digital TV services
that is compliant with version 5 of the DVB API, and backward compatible with
the older v3 DVB API.
.PP
dvbv5-scan uses by default the new channel/service file format that it is
capable of supporting all types of Digital TV standards. It can also support
the legacy format used by the legacy dvb-apps.
.PP
A single physical channel (also called as transponder) may have several virtual
channels inside it, encapsulated via a MPEG Transport stream.
.PP
Those virtual channels are called as 'service' at the MPEG-TS terminology, and
may have one or more audio, video and other types of elements inside it.
.PP
The dvbv5-scan goal is to scan for a list of physical channels/transponders
and identify there the MPEG-TS services available.
.PP
The dvbv5-scan tool is smart enough to retrieve the information at the
MPEG-TS Network Information Table (NIT) about other channels available
on the stream.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
The following options are valid:
.TP
\fB\-3\fR, \fB\-\-dvbv3\fR
Force dvbv5\-scan to use DVBv3 only.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-adapter\fR=\fIadapter#\fR
Use the given adapter. Default value: 0.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-cc\fR=\fIcountry_code\fR
Set the default country to be used by the MPEG-TS parsers, in ISO 3166-1 two
letter code. If not specified, the default charset is guessed from the
locale environment variables.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-demux\fR=\fIdemux#\fR
Use the given demux. Default value: 0.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-frontend\fR=\fIfrontend#\fR
Use the given frontend. Default value: 0.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-file-freqs-only\fR
Don't use the other frequencies discovered during scan. By default, dvbv5-scan
will find new transponder/physical channels and add them at the internal
frequency table it uses for scan. This option disables such feature.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-get_frontend\fR
Use data from get_frontend on the output file. By default, dvbv5-scan will
repeat the same network parameters as found at the scan file. This should
work fine if the output file will be used by the same frontend. However, if
you intend to use the generated file on another frontend, or wants a faster
tuner, this option can be used to store the actual detected parameters, instead
of the ones that came from the source channel file.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-input-format\fR=\fIformat\fR
Format of the input file. Please notice that caps is ignored. It can be:
.RS
.TP
\fIchannel\fR         \- for dvb-apps compatible channel file;
.PP
\fIzap\fR             \- for dvb-apps compatible zap file;
.PP
\fIdvbv5\fR (default) \- for the dvbv5 apps format.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lnbf\fR=\fILNBf_type\fR
Type of LNBf to use 'help' lists the available ones.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nit\fR
Use data from NIT table on the output file. By default, dvbv5-scan will
repeat the same network parameters as found at the scan file. This should
work fine if the output file will be used by the same frontend. However, if
you intend to use the generated file on another frontend, or wants a faster
tuner, this option can be used to store the parameters that are announced
by the broadcaster via the MPEG-TS Network Information Table (NIT), instead
of the ones that came from the source channel file.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIfile\fR
output filename (default: \fBdvb_channel.conf\fR)
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-output\-format\fR=\fIformat\fR
Output format:
.RS
.TP
\fIchannel\fR         \- for dvb-apps compatible channel file;
.PP
\fIzap\fR             \- for dvb-apps compatible zap file;
.PP
\fIvdr\fR             \- for vdr compatible zap file;
.PP
\fIdvbv5\fR (default) \- for the dvbv5 apps format.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-parse\-other\-nit\fR
Parse the other NIT/SDT tables that could be found mainly on some DVB-C
carriers.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sat_number\fR=\fIsatellite_number\fR
Satellite number.
Used only on satellite delivery systems.
If not specified, disable DISEqC satellite switch.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\-multiply\fR=\fIfactor\fR
Multiply the scan lock wait time and MPEG-TS table parsing by this factor.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-freq_bpf\fR=\fIfrequency\fR
SCR/Unicable band-pass filter frequency to use, in kHz.
Used only on satellite delivery systems.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be (very) verbose. Useful to check if the MPEG-TS is happenning fine.
This option can be used multiple times to increase verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-lna\fR=\fILNA\fR
Enable, disable or put LNA power in auto mode. Not all frontends support it.
Valid values are:
.RS
.TP
 0 \- disable
.TP
 1 \- enable
.TP
\-1 \- auto
.RE
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-wait\fR=\fItime\fR
Adds additional wait time for DISEqC command completion.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Outputs the usage help.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Gives a short usage message.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints the program version.
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
optional for any corresponding short options.
.RS
.SS NOTE
If both \fB\-\-nit\fR and \fB\-\-get_frontend\fR options are used at the
same time, the \fB\-\-nit\fR parameters will be applied after the ones that
the frontend detected.
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
On success, it returns 0.

The scan process will then scan the other 38 discovered new transponders,
and generate a dvb_channel.conf with several entries with will have not only
the physical channel/transponder info, but also the Service ID, and the
corresponding audio/video/other program IDs (PID), like:
.PP
.nf

        SERVICE_ID = 5
        VIDEO_PID = 288
        AUDIO_PID = 289
        FREQUENCY = 573000000
        MODULATION = QAM/256
