.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
This program shows content from a system console on a LCD controlled by
\fBLCDd\fR. As the console is usually larger than a LCD, the area shown on
the LCD screen can be scrolled using keys attached to the display.
.LP
Additionally it has an autoscroll feature, which is on by default and can
only be disabled by using \fBlcdvc\fR's menu.
.LP
By default it uses \fI/dev/vcs\fR and \fI/dev/vcsa\fR devices as the
console to show. Other console devices can be set in the configuration file
\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/lcdvc.conf\fR. The keys used for scrolling can be set in the config
file as well.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP

\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/lcdvc.conf\fR as well, but those given on the command line take
precedence:
