Licensing
=========

The project is currently licensed using GPLv3. For full text see:

> http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt   
> [GPLv3](licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)

However we are currently in the process of seeking CLAs from all contributors. This will provide the project with the potential to re-license under any OSI approved license.

The intention is that once agreements have been received from all members we will begin to re-license the code under GPLv2.

Should you be interested in using Tvheadend and wish to use another OSI license, then please contact admin at tvheadend dot org.

Code not Covered
----------------

Code in the "vendor" directory is not covered by our license, it is 3rd party
provided code and as such is governed by individual licenses.

Code that is not yet covered by the CLAs will retain the original copyright header and GPLv3 license. However as things are migrated the headers and in-line license details will be updated.

Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
-----------------------------------

All contributors to Tvheadend are required to sign a CLA, which gives the
project a perpetual license to use the contribution as the project deems best
(within the terms of the agreement).
