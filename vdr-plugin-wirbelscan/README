Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin performs channel scans for digital tv cards.

Requirements:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - VDR Version >= 1.7.x or
 - developer versions of plugin: vdr >= 2.3.1

Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install this plugin: unpack it into VDRs Plugin source folder
and compile it as usual.
Replace $VERSION with the actual plugins version like '0.0.1' and
$SOURCEDIR with your path to the sources, usually /usr/src or similar:


cp vdr-wirbelscan-$VERSION.tgz $SOURCEDIR/vdr-1.7.16/PLUGINS
cd $SOURCEDIR/VDR/PLUGINS
tar xfz vdr-wirbelscan-$VERSION.tgz
ln -s wirbelscan-$VERSION wirbelscan
cd $SOURCEDIR/VDR
make plugins


How To Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#0 open plugins setup menu page
#1 adjust your country 
#2 define the search in the field 'Source Type'
#3 MAKE SHURE, THAT YOU DONT HAVE TIMERS ON SCHEDULE. Otherwise you may loose them.
#4 Start the scan with the GREEN key and wait. This will take some time, up to 30 min.


Specific Problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- On some dvb cards, the I/Q inversion needs to be explicitly switched on or off.
  If you find cards *only* working with INVERSION = ON, please report those as *bug* to
  the linux-media dvb driver mailing list.

- Hint:
  For experts: setting symbolrate and modulation to well known values will speed up the scan.
  Nevertheless - with wrong settings some or even all transponders will be lost. 


Some words of warning and information:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Reporting Bugs:
  - please send me a full log from the plugin with Verbosity = 5 setting
    from beginning of scan up to the point where your problem occurs
  - please include hardware details of your system and VDR's setup.conf

* Version Numbering:
  - versions with 'X.Y.Z-pre-XX' are to be understood as Version before the version X.Y.Z;
    so 0.0.5-pre1 is *older* as 0.0.5
  - there is no stable version up to now.

* do NOT scan if you have some recording on your schedule.
  This plugin will steel you the dvb card, regardless wether your recording
  will break.

* the plugin will add new channels - as vdr everytime does - at the end
  of the channels list, so if you have a timer on schedule it may cause
  problems.
