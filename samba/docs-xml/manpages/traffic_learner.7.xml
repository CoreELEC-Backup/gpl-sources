	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
	<para>This tool is part of the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> suite.</para>

	<para>This tool assists with generation of Samba traffic.
	It takes a traffic-summary file (produced by
	<command>traffic_summary.pl</command>) as input and produces a
	traffic-model file that can be used by <command>traffic_replay</command>
	for traffic generation.</para>

	<para>The model file summarizes the types of traffic ('conversations'
	between a host and a Samba DC) that occur on a network. The model file
	describes the traffic in a way that allows it to be scaled so that
	either more (or fewer) packets get sent, and the packets can be sent at
	a faster (or slower) rate than that seen in the network.</para>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>-h|--help</term>
	<listitem><para>
	Print a summary of command line options.

	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>SUMMARY_FILE</term>
	<listitem><para>
	File containing a network traffic-summary. The traffic-summary file
	should be generated by <command>traffic_summary.pl</command> from a
	packet capture of actual network traffic.
	More than one file can be specified, in which case the traffic will
	be combined into a single traffic-model. If no SUMMARY_FILE is
	specified, this tool will read the traffic-summary from STDIN, i.e.
	you can pipe the output from traffic_summary.pl directly to this tool.
	</para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	<term>-o|--out OUTPUT_FILE</term>
	<listitem><para>
	The traffic-model that is produced will be written to this file. The
	OUTPUT_FILE can then be passed to <command>traffic_replay</command>
	to generate (and manipulate) Samba network traffic.

	<title>EXAMPLES</title>

	<para>To take a traffic-summary file and produce a traffic-model
	file, use:</para>

	<para><command>traffic_learner traffic-summary.txt
	-o traffic-model.txt</command></para>

	<para>To generate a traffic-model from a packet capture, you can
	pipe the traffic summary to STDIN using:</para>

	<para><command>tshark -r capture.pcapng -T pdml |
	traffic_summary.pl | traffic_learner -o traffic-model.txt</command></para>
</refsect1>

	<title>OUTPUT FILE FORMAT</title>

	<para>The output model file describes a Markov model estimating the
	probability of a packet occurring given the last two packets.</para>

	<para>The count of each continuation after a pair of
	successive packets is stored, and the ratios of these counts
	is used to calculate probabilities for the next packet.
	</para>

	<para>The model is stored in JSON format, and also contains
	information about the packet rate and DNS traffic rate.</para>

	<title>Example ngram listing</title>
	<para>The following listing shows a contrived example of a single ngram entry.
        </para>

        <programlisting>
          "ngrams": {
             "ldap:0\tdcerpc:11": {
                 "lsarpc:77": 1,
                 "ldap:2": 370,
                 "ldap:3": 62,
                 "wait:3": 2,
                 "-": 1
             }, <lineannotation>[...]</lineannotation>
          }
        </programlisting>
        <para> This counts the observed continuations after an ldap
        packet with opcode 0 (a bind) followed by a dcerpc packet with
        opcode 11 (also a bind). The most common next packet is
        "<code>ldap:2</code>" which is an unbind, so this is the most
        likely packet type to be selected in replay. At the other
        extreme, lsarpc opcode 77 (lookup names) has been seen only
        once, and it is unlikely but possible that this will be
        selected in replay.
        </para>
        <para> There are two special packet types here.
        "<code>wait:3</code>" refers to a temporary pause in the
        conversation, where the "<code>3</code>" pseudo-opcode indicates
        the length of the wait on an exponential scale. That is, a
        "<code>wait:4</code>" pause would be about 2.7 times longer that
        a "<code>wait:3</code>", which in turn would be similarly longer
        than a "<code>wait:2</code>".
        </para>

	<para>The other special packet is "-", which represents the
	limit of the conversation. In the example, this indicates that
	one observed conversation ended after this particular ngram.
	This special opcode is also used at the beginning of
	conversations, which are indicated by the ngram "<code>-\t-</code>".
	</para>
