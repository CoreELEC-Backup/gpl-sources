	<para>If the "nbtd:wins_randomize1Clist" parameter is set to "yes",
	then randomizing of the first returned address is based on the
	specified netmask. If there are addresses which are in the same subnet
	as the client address, the first returned address is randomly chosen
	out them.  Otherwise the first returned address is randomly chosen out
	of all addresses.
