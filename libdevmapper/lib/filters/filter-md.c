#define MSG_SKIPPING "%s: Skipping md component device"

/*
 * The purpose of these functions is to ignore md component devices,
 * e.g. if /dev/md0 is a raid1 composed of /dev/loop0 and /dev/loop1,
 * lvm wants to deal with md0 and ignore loop0 and loop1.  md0 should
 * pass the filter, and loop0,loop1 should not pass the filter so lvm
 * will ignore them.
 *
 * (This is assuming lvm.conf md_component_detection=1.)
 *
 * If lvm does *not* ignore the components, then lvm may read lvm
 * labels from the component devs and potentially the md dev,
 * which can trigger duplicate detection, and/or cause lvm to display
 * md components as PVs rather than ignoring them.
 *
 * If scanning md componenents causes duplicates to be seen, then
 * the lvm duplicate resolution will exclude the components.
 *
 * The lvm md filter has three modes:
 *
 * 1. look for md superblock at the start of the device
 * 2. look for md superblock at the start and end of the device
 * 3. use udev to detect components
 *
 * mode 1 will not detect and exclude components of md devices
 * that use superblock version 0.9 or 1.0 which is at the end of the device.
 *
 * mode 2 will detect these, but mode 2 doubles the i/o done by label
 * scan, since there's a read at both the start and end of every device.
 *
 * mode 3 is used when external_device_info_source="udev".  It does
 * not require any io from lvm, but this mode is not used by default
 * because there have been problems getting reliable info from udev.
 *
 * lvm uses mode 2 when:
 *
 * - the command is pvcreate/vgcreate/vgextend, which format new
 *   devices, and if the user ran these commands on a component
 *   device of an md device 0.9 or 1.0, then it would cause problems.
 *   FIXME: this would only really need to scan the end of the
 *   devices being formatted, not all devices.
 *
 * - it sees an md device on the system using version 0.9 or 1.0.
 *   The point of this is just to avoid displaying md components
 *   from the 'pvs' command.
 *   FIXME: the cost (double i/o) may not be worth the benefit
 *   (not showing md components).
 */

/*
 * Returns 0 if:
 * the device is an md component and it should be ignored.
 *
 * Returns 1 if:
 * the device is not md component and should not be ignored.
 *
 * The actual md device will pass this filter and should be used,
 * it is the md component devices that we are trying to exclude
 * that will not pass.
