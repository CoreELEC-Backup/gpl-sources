On archlinux you'll find a PKGBUILD file in the appropriate folder.
On Debian/Ubuntu you have to download the package-source from the yavdr-repository and rebuild it.

How to build on Debian/Ubuntu:
 Clone the git repository or download a copy of it and move to the root directory.
 Install all dependencies.
 Type: dpkg-buildpackage -tc -us -uc

How to install on Arch-Linux:
 Clone the git repository, move to archlinux/vdr-plugin-restfulapi-local/ and type "makepkg PKGBUILD".

Alternate way on Arch-Linux:
 Move to archlinux/vdr-plugin-resfulapi-git/ on github and download the PKGBUILD and vdr-plugin-restfulapi-git.install in it.
 Move to the directory where you've downloaded them and execute "makepkg PKGBUILD".
 
 If you want to build restfulapi without libmagick++ compile with
 
 make USE_LIBMAGICKPLUSPLUS=0
