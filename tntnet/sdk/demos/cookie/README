Demo-application "cookie" 
========================

This application extends the "hello"-demo-application with cookie-support. The
entered name is stored in a cookie for 1 hour.

To run the application enter "tntnet" in this directory. If you 
have not yet installed but only built tntnet, you need to enter the path to 
the generated tntnet-program: 
  "../../../framework/runtime/tntnet"

You can see the result in your browser at http://localhost:8000/cookie
