    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Configuring lircmd (the LIRC mouse daemon)</H1>

    <P>
      <em>lircmd</em> can be used to emulate a mouse with your remote
      control. Depending on the config file described in the next
      section it converts IR signals into mouse events. It currently
      supports three mouse protocols (MouseSystems, IntelliMouse and
      IMPS/2). For compatibility reasons the default protocol is the
      MouseSystems protocol but the preferred is the IntelliMouse
      protocol. The advantage of this protocol is its wheel-mouse
      support. That way you can for example configure Netscape to
      scroll if you press certain buttons.
    </P>

    <P>
      IMPS/2 used to be the preferred protocol since it also has
      wheel-mouse support and IntelliMouse was not available. However
      PS/2 protocol specifies that the mouse must accept and reply to
      specific commands, and that can not be done through the pipe
      <em>lircmd</em> uses. For this reason IntelliMouse support was
      written and is currently the preferred protocol.
    </P>

    <P>
      lircmd can basically be used with two applications: X11 and gpm
      Using gpm makes no sense with a modern X installation since this
      supports multiple mouses natively.</p>


    <H3>X11</H3>

      Put this section in your Xorg.conf file to use the lircmd

    <H3> uinput  and effective user </h3>
    <p>
    If your distribution does not have uinput enabled by default
    (i. e., there is a /dev/uinput device) add to the file /etc/modules
    the entry: </p>
<pre>
             uinput
</pre>
    To make this device writable for regular users
    create a new file /etc/udev/rules.d/55-uinput with one line
<pre>
             KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0666"
</pre>
<p>
    However, this has security implications. The preferred setup is to use
    the example rule in the contrib directory which makes
    <em>/dev/uinput</em> accessible for the lirc user, and then run lircmd
    as this user</p>
<p>
    Another alternative is to run lircmd as root. In this case this no udev
    rule is required, but it raises other security concerns.</p>
<p>
    Finally, run lircmd with the --uinput option (which can be set in
    lirc_options.conf).</p>

    <H3>systemd</H3>
    LIRC ships with systemd support files. To start lircmd, use
<pre>
             # systemd start lircmd.service
</pre>
    To make it start at boot time use:
<pre>
             # systemd enable lircmd.service
</pre>

      The config file for lircmd is quite simple. Just look at the

      bring their config file for lircmd with them so lircmd is ready
      to run.

          Change the values here if your mouse pointer is moving too
          fast/slow. Usually the mouse pointer moves 1 pixel every
          time it receives a signal. The values here specify how much
          mouse movement accelerates if you hold down the according
          button on your remote control for a longer timer. The
          <em>start</em> value is the threshold that starts
          acceleration. Then the amount of pixels is calculated with
          the following formula:
          <em>x</em>=<em>repeat</em>*<em>multiplier</em>, where repeat
          is the number of repeated signals. <em>max</em> specifies

        <P>
          The difference between ACTIVATE and TOGGLE_ACTIVATE is how

          press the button that you use to enter the mode to leave
          it. With ACTIVATE you will leave mouse mode as soon as you

    <!-- .lircrc file format ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="lircrc_format"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The <em>lircrc</em> file format</H1>

    <P>
      The <em>lircrc</em> file is used to map the key symbols defined
      in <em>lircd.conf</em> to application-specific strings. Thus,
      this file cannot be configured until lircd has been
      configured to provide proper key symbols as displayed by
      <a href="irw.html">irw</a>.</p>
    <p>
      The <em>lircrc</em> file should be placed in the home
      directory as <em>~/.config/lircrc</em>. Optionally you
      can create a system-wide configuration file located in
      <em>/etc/lirc/lircrc</em> which will be used when no
      <em>lircrc</em>file can be found in the user's home directory. The idea
      is to have configuration information of all clients in one
      place. That lets you keep a better overview of clients and
      simplifies the use of modes explained later.
    <p>
      The preferred setup is to have a main <em>~/.lircrc</em>
      which includes a number of other files, typically  living in
      <em>~/.config/lircrc/*</em>. The contrib directory contains
      a number of example files, most of which created using
      <em>lirc-config-tool</em> for an ordinary MCE remote </p>
    <P>
      First I will explain the syntax of the <em>lircrc</em>file itself.
      The file consists of one or more of the following constructions:
    </P>
    <PRE>
    begin
        prog    = ...
        remote  = ...
        button  = ...
        [button = ...] (optional, for key sequences)
        repeat  = ...
        delay   = ...
        ignore_first_events = ...
        config  = ...
        [config = ...] (optional, for toggle button behaviour)
        mode    = ...
        flags   = ...
    end</PRE>
    <P>
      Bringing it to the point the above says which program
      (<em>prog</em>) should do what (<em>config</em>, <em>mode</em>,
      <em>flags</em>) if you press a certain button (<em>remote</em>,
      <em>button</em>) a specified time (<em>repeat</em>,
      <em>delay</em>). By default for each remote signal received the
      <em>lircrc</em> config file is read from top to bottom and
      each matching configuration is executed in order of appearance.
    </P>
    <DL>
      <DT>prog</DT>
      <DD>gives the name of the program that should receive the
        configstring given in config.
      </DD>
      <DT>remote, button</DT> <DD>specify a key of a remote control
        that launches an action. Key sequences can be specified by
        giving more then one remote/button string (<em>not</em> on the
        same line, but using separate remote/button tokens on separate
        lines). The character '*' can be used as a wild card for remote
        or button. The default for remote is '*'. The remote name must
        always be given before its according button. When using key
        sequences a given remote is valid for all following buttons
        until you specify another remote.
      </DD>
      <DT>repeat</DT>
      <DD>tells the program what shall happen if a key is repeated.  A
        value of zero tells the program to ignore repeated keys.  Any
        other positive value 'n' tells the program to pass the config
        string every 'n'-th time to the according application, when a
        key is repeated. The default for repeat is zero.
      </DD>
      <DT>delay</DT>
      <DD>tells the program to ignore the specified number of key repeats
        before using the &quot;repeat&quot; configuration directive
        above. This is used to prevent double triggers of events when
        using a fast repeat rate. A value of zero, which also is the
        default, will disable the delay function. If &quot;repeat&quot;
        value is zero but &quot;delay&quot; is set, there will be a
        single event generated after the delay period expires (with
        another one before delay period starts).
      </DD>
      <DT>ignore_first_events</DT>
      <DD>ignores the specified amount of first events.
        Same as &quot;delay&quot; but without an event before delay
        period starts. This allows to define the reaction on the long
        key presses. Should not be set together with &quot;delay&quot;.
      </DD>
      <DT>config</DT>
      <DD>is the string that will be passed to the according
        application whenever the specified key sequence is received by
        lircd. If you give more than one config string, the config
        strings will be passed to the applications by turns. With this
        feature you can for example implement toggle buttons.<BR>

        You can pass non-printable characters to applications with all
        standard C escape sequences (most common are: \n = line-feed,
        \r = carriage return, \t = tab, \e = escape,
        \&lt;<em>n</em>&gt; = ASCII code in octal representation,
        \x&lt;<em>n</em>&gt; = ASCII code in hexadecimal
        representation, \\ = backslash). Additionally you can supply
        Ctrl-X by specifying \X where X is an upper character or
        @. For example \C is Ctrl-C.
      </DD>
      <DT>mode</DT>
      <DD>tells the program to enter a special mode. You can group
        several configurations by putting them into the following,
        where mode stands for the mode where these configurations
        should be active:

        <PRE>
    begin mode
        ...
    end mode</PRE>

        All configurations embraced by this mode construct will stay
        inactive until the program enters the given mode by using the
        mode token. Please note that configurations outside a mode
        will always stay active even though you enter a specific mode.
        To prevent the execution of such &quot;global&quot;
        configurations you can place these at the end of the config
        file below all mode constructs and use the <em>quit</em> flag
        described below to stop execution of further configurations
        when a match happens inside a mode block.

        If mode is equal to the name of a client application this
        application will always start in this mode. Consider this
        situation: you want to start <em>xawtv</em> with
        <em>irexec</em> and enter the <em>tv</em> mode. Then irexec
        would enter the tv mode but xawtv would begin without any mode
        enabled. By renaming the mode from <em>tv</em> to
        <em>xawtv</em> you can solve this problem.

        <br>Another way to specify a startup mode is by using the
        startup_mode flag as described below.<BR>
        <BR>
        <em>Caveat:</em> In order to avoid many identical entries all
        actions that modify the mode a program currently is in are
        independent of the <em>prog</em> token.
      </DD>
    </DL>
    The following are valid flags:
    <DL>
      <DT>once</DT>

      <DD>
        This is only allowed in conjunction with the mode
        directive. The config string is passed to the application only
        the first time the mode is entered or you have explicitly left
        this mode. This is useful for starting an application whenever
        you enter a special mode.
      </DD>
      <DT>quit</DT>
      <DD>Usually all configurations are examined whether they have
        to be executed. You can stop this immediately with this
        flag. Configurations further below will not be executed if
        the current button press matches the current configuration. A
        match also happens if the current configuration defines a
        button sequence and only part of the sequence already was
        entered.
      </DD>
      <DT>mode</DT>
      <DD>This is only allowed within a mode block. It tells the
        program to leave this mode.
      </DD>
      <DT>startup_mode</DT>
      <DD>
        Tells the program to start in the mode given in the mode
        keyword.  The following example tells the program to start in
        the <em>browser</em> mode
        <PRE>
begin
        flags = startup_mode
        mode = browser
end</PRE>
      </DD>
      <DT>toggle_reset</DT> <DD>This will only have an effect if you
      have specified several <em>config</em> lines to implement a
      toggle button. Usually the toggle state is always saved for the
      button regardless of other button presses. But with this flag
      the toggle state will be reset to the first config entry as soon
      as a different button not matching the specification in the
      current block is pressed.
      </DD>
    </DL>

    <P>
      If you press a button on your remote the <em>lircrc</em> is searched
      from top to bottom for matching configurations. Be aware that
      the search is not stopped by a match unless you have specified
      the <em>quit</em> flag in the matching configuration. You should
      also be aware that if a configuration changes the current mode,
      the change takes effect immediately, which means that the
      further search for matching configurations beginning at the next
      configuration further down will take place with the new mode
      setting.
    </P>

    <P>
      It is possible to split the lirc configuration into several
      files by using the <em>include</em> command. It tells the parser
      to read the specified file before resuming the current one:
    </P>
    <PRE>
include ~/.config/lirc/xawtv</PRE>
    <P>
      If the specified filename begins with &quot;~/&quot;,
      &quot;~&quot; will be substituted with the content of the
      <em>HOME</em> environment variable. The filename also can be put
      inside &lt;&gt; and &quot;&quot; characters which in contrast to
      the C preprocessor do not have special meanings.
    </P>
    <P>
      A simple example for a <em>lircrc</em> file (supposing
      you using an AnimaX remote and use the sample files for this
      remote from the remotes database. If you have another remote
      change <em>remote=</em> and <em>button=</em> according to your
      remote [t definitions are made in the <em>lircd.conf</em>
      file]):
    </P>

    <PRE>
    begin
        remote = ANIMAX
        button = MENU_DOWN
        prog   = irexec
        repeat = 0
        config = echo &quot;Hello world!&quot;
    end</PRE>
    <P>
      If you have saved this as <em>~/.config/lircrc</em> , start
      <em>irexec</em>. Press the button which is
      selected in the <em>button=</em> line and you will see a 'Hello
      world!' on your screen. As you can see irexec is a simple
      program launcher. Of course you can do a lot more than just
      start programs. Be aware that irexec will wait for the started
      program to finish, before it will resume it function. If this is
      not what you want, you should add a &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end
      of the config line to start the desired program in background.
    </P>

    <P>
      Differences in the order of configurations in <em>lircrc</em> can
      lead to completely different results, as this example shows:
    </P>
    <PRE>
      begin order
      begin
           button = OK
           prog = irexec

      end
      end order

      begin
           button = OK
           prog = irexec
           config = echo "This is printed first"
           mode = order
           flags = quit
      end</PRE>
    <P>
      Using this order on first key stroke of OK
    </P>
    <PRE>
      "This is printed first"</PRE>
    <P>
      will appear  - the command is executed and the mode 'order' is entered.
      The second stroke (and every further one) will lead to
    </P>
    <PRE>
      "This is printed last"
      "This is printed first"</PRE>
    <P>
      Both configs are executed, even though the second is outside the mode;
      the quit flag has no effect  - no other config is following it in
      the <em>lircrc</em> file.
    </P>
    <P>
      Changing the order within the <em>lircrc</em> to
    </P>
    <PRE>
      begin
           button = OK
           prog = irexec
           config = echo "This is printed first"
           mode = order
           flags = quit
      end

      begin order
      begin
           button = OK
           prog = irexec
           config = echo "This is printed last"
      end
      end order</PRE>
    <P>
      will lead to
    </P>
    <PRE>
      "This is printed first"</PRE>
    <P>
      on every stroke. The second config is never executed: even
      though the mode is changed it can not take effect (because of
      the quit flag). To achieve unrestricted usage of keys within
      modes place all mode-configurations <em>before</em> all other
      configurations; and use quit flags within the mode if you don't
      want other configurations to be executed.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you start a LIRC client program, it reads your
      <em>~/.config/lircrc</em>
      and reacts only on prog= entries which point to itself. All programs
      should give you the possibility to use an alternative config
      file. If you have included more than one program in your
      <em>lircrc</em>, then start all these programs, they react only to their
      according entries in <em>lircrc</em>. This also leads to a disadvantage
      of the mode concept. If you don't start all client programs at a
      time the mode they currently are in may differ between
      applications. Also key sequences might not be recognized equally
      because all programs then don't have the same starting point. In
      order to solve this problem there is the
      <a HREF="lircrcd.html">lircrcd</A> program since version
      0.8.0. lircrcd's purpose is to synchronise all clients and
      maintain a common mode for all applications. In order to use the
      lircrcd feature you have to explicitly enable it by adding the
      following line at the beginning of the file: </p>
<pre>
lircrc_class default
</pre>
     <p>
      This directive can only be used in a top-level file, not in an
      included one. The string  <code>default</code> could actually be
      any identifier; clients using a lircrc with the same string will
      synchronized. </p>
     <p>
      In versions before 0.9.2 the same effect was acheived with a "shebang",
      a first line in the file <code>#! lircrcd</code> From 0.9.2+, the
      support for this deprecated and it will be removed in an upcoming
      release.</p>

    <P>
      The LIRC package contains the <A HREF="irsend.html">irsend</A> tool for
      sending infrared signals to e.g. your TV or CD player. For
      reliable transmission a good config file is even more important
      than for receiving. A discussion of all the infrared protocols
      is way beyond the scope of this manual but when creating a
      config file at least read the <A HREF="help.html">hints</A> at the
      end of this manual. You can find exact timing specifications for most
      common protocols in files retrieved from the remotes database located
      using <i>irdb-get find generic</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      LIRC also provides interfaces to develop applications which sends
      data. Sine 0.9.2, the primary interface is the
      <a href="lirc_client.html">client API</a>.
