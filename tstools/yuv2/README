YUV2: A YUV viewer.
------------------

YUV2 is a cross-platform Java YUV file viewer intended for video
codec engineers. It includes pseudo-video playback, macroblock
and pixel value viewers for both frame and field mode.

It'll get extended as we need more features - do feel free to jump
in and help.

This initial release is for Linux only (because that's what I've
got on my desktop). To get things working on Windows you will need
to translate the GNU makefile into a Windows NMAKE file or (more 
likely) a batch script and use the Windows SWT.

You will need SWT, available from <http://www.eclipse.org/swt/>.

This code was originally written for SJ Consulting and originally
released by Amino Communications Ltd in March 2008 - I've only just
got around to tidying it up enough that it deserves a public release.

TO BUILD YUV2
-------------

Set JAVA_HOME to where your Java is - e.g. /usr/local/jdk1.6.0_07 .
Set SWTDIR to wherever your swt.jar is.
Type 'make'.
Copy yuv2.jar to somewhere convenient (default is /usr/local/lib)
Edit bin/yuv2 to reflect the directory where you put yuv2.
Copy bin/yuv2 to somewhere on your PATH.
Report (or better still, fix) the bugs!
