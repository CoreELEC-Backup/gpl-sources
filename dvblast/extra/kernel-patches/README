About DVBlast kernel patches
============================

These kernel patches are designed to dramatically improve the latency
between the DVB card and DVBlast's output, especially on low symbol rate
transponders, at the expense of a slightly higher CPU consumption.

Basically they decrease the size of the transmission buffers from the card
to 4 kB, so that TS packets are handled more frequently.
