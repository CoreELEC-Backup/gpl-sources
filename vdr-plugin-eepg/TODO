TODO/WISH:
-Missing support for Freesat DVB-T
-extend equivalents file with transponder SKIP (do not retrieve EEPG info) or 
 transponder ONCE (retrieve once a day, first possiblity after midnight). 
 TUNE (retrieve every time transponder gets tuned to) transponder CONT (retrieve continuously)
-look at collisions and language problems (eg Cyfra at MTV) 
-check broadcasting frequencys + windows of all providers; report first event seen and last event seen
-use event-> as database instead of title[] and summary[] , except for MHW1
-try to minimize resync problems by using sliding window after "lock" on 50 succesfull sequential syncs or so
-stop premiere after having read all titles (from CONT to ONCE)
-check version info for all providers
-decode summary-available bit for OpenTV
-parallellize when not on FF card
-NAGRA 2nd textstring is not used right now, find out when it is relevant...
