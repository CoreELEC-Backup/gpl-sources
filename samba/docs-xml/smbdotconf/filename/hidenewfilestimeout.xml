   <para>Setting this parameter to something but 0 hides files
   that have been modified less than N seconds ago.</para>
   <para>It can be used for ingest/process queue style workloads. A
   processing application should only see files that are definitely
   finished. As many applications do not have proper external workflow
   control, this can be a way to make sure processing does not
   interfere with file ingest.</para>
