Dear Marco d'Itri,

For the month October, 2002:
We had 55 milion queries, 4.3 milion done with your client.

This number is probably not the best indicator as some IPs do a lot of
queries so here are also the statistics for different IP addresses using
your client:
31364 (of 853385) different IP addresses used your client.

If you have any more questions, please contact <ripe-dbm@ripe.net>.

Regards,

Tiago Antao

   I have forwarded your request to ripe-dbm@ripe.net. You can contact that 
address if you'd like more/less specific requirements about the counts.
