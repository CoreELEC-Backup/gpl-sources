	<para>Normally queries for 0x1C names will return the addresses in the
	same order as they're stored in the database, that means first all
	addresses which have been directly registered at the local wins server
	and then all addresses registered at other servers. Windows servers
	have an option to change this behavior and randomize the returned
	addresses. Set this parameter to "yes" and Samba will sort the
	address list depending on the client address and the matching bits of
	the addresses, the first address is randomized based on depending on
	the "nbtd:wins_randomize1Clist_mask" parameter.
