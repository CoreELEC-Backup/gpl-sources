	<para>winbindd is able to get kerberos tickets for
	pam_winbind with krb5_auth or wbinfo -K/--krb5auth=.

	<para>winbindd (at least on a domain member) is never be able
	to have a complete picture of the trust topology (which is managed by the DCs).
	There might be uPNSuffixes and msDS-SPNSuffixes values,
	which don't belong to any AD domain at all.
	</para>

	<para>With <smbconfoption name="winbind scan trusted domains">no</smbconfoption>
	winbindd don't even get an incomplete picture of the topology.
	</para>

	<para>It is not really required to know about the trust topology.
	We can just rely on the [K]DCs of our primary domain (e.g. PRIMARY.A.EXAMPLE.COM)
	and use enterprise principals e.g. upnfromB@B.EXAMPLE.COM@PRIMARY.A.EXAMPLE.COM
	and follow the WRONG_REALM referrals in order to find the correct DC.
	The final principal might be userfromB@INTERNALB.EXAMPLE.PRIVATE.
	</para>

	<para>With <smbconfoption name="winbind use krb5 enterprise principals">yes</smbconfoption>
	winbindd enterprise principals will be used.
