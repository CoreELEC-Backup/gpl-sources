NAME
        How to build fstrcmp

SPACE REQUIREMENTS
        You will need about 3MB to unpack and build the fstrcmp package.  Your
        milage may vary.

BEFORE YOU START
        There are a few pieces of software you may want to fetch and install
        before you proceed with your installation of fstrcmp

        GNU libtool
                The libtool program is used to build shared libraries.  It
                understands neccesary weird and wonderful compiler and linker
                tricks on many weird and wonderful systems.
                http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

        GNU Groff
                The documentation for the fstrcmp package was prepared using
                the GNU Groff package (version 1.14 or later).  This
                distribution includes full documentation, which may be
                processed into PostScript or DVI files at install time - if
                GNU Groff has been installed.

        GCC     You may also want to consider fetching and installing the GNU
                C Compiler if you have not done so already.  This is not
                essential.  The fstrcmp program was developed using the GNU C
                compiler.

        The GNU FTP archives may be found at ftp.gnu.org, and are mirrored
        around the world.

SITE CONFIGURATION
        The fstrcmp package is configured using the configure program included
        in the source distribution.

        The configure shell script attempts to guess correct values for
        various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
        creates the Makefile and lib/config.h files.  It also creates a shell
        script config.status that you can run in the future to recreate the
        current configuration.

        Normally, you just cd to the directory containing fstrcmp's source
        code and then type
                % ./configure
                ...lots of output...
                %
        If you're using csh on an old version of System V, you might need to
        type
                % sh configure
                ...lots of output...
                %
        instead, to prevent csh from trying to execute configure itself.

        Running configure takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
        prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
        see the messages, run configure using the quiet option; for example,
                % ./configure --quiet
                %

        To compile the fstrcmp package in a different directory from the one
        containing the source code, you must use a version of make that
        supports the VPATH variable, such as GNU make.  Then cd to the
        directory where you want the object files and executables to go and
        run the configure script.  The configure script automatically checks
        for the source code in the directory that configure is in and in ..
        (the parent directory).  If for some reason configure is not in the
        source code directory that you are configuring, then it will report
        that it can't find the source code.  In that case, run configure with
        the option --srcdir=DIR, where DIR is the directory that contains the
        source code.

        By default, configure will arrange for the make install command to
        install the fstrcmp package's files in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib,
        /usr/local/include, and /usr/local/man.  There are options which allow
        you to control the placement of these files.

        --prefix=PATH
                This specifies the path prefix to be used in the installation.
                Defaults to /usr/local unless otherwise specified.

        --exec-prefix=PATH
                You can specify separate installation prefixes for
                architecture-specific files files.  Defaults to ${prefix}
                unless otherwise specified.

        --bindir=PATH
                This directory contains executable programs.  On a network,
                this directory may be shared between machines with identical
                hardware and operating systems; it may be mounted read-only.
                Defaults to ${exec_prefix}/bin unless otherwise specified.

        --mandir=PATH
                This directory contains the on-line manual entries.  On a
                network, this directory may be shared between all machines; it
                may be mounted read-only.  Defaults to ${prefix}/man unless
                otherwise specified.

        The configure script ignores most other arguments that you give it;
        use the --help option for a complete list.

        On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking
        that the fstrcmp package's configure script does not know about, you
        can give configure initial values for variables by setting them in the
        environment.  In Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the
        command line like this:
                $ CXX='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix ./configure
                ...lots of output...
                $
        Here are the make variables that you might want to override with
        environment variables when running the configure script:

        Variable: CC
                C compiler program.  The default is cc.

        Variable: CPPFLAGS
                Preprocessor flags, commonly defines and include search paths.
                Defaults to empty.  It is common to use
                CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include to access other installed
                packages.

        Variable: INSTALL
                Program to use to install files.  The default is install if
                you have it, cp otherwise.

        Variable: LIBS
                Libraries to link with, in the form -lfoo -lbar.  The
                configure script will append to this, rather than replace it.
                It is common to use LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib to access other
                installed packages.

        If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, the author
        encourages you to figure out how the configure script could check
        whether to do them, and mail diffs or instructions to the author so
        that they can be included in the next release.

BUILDING FSTRCMP
        All you should need to do is use the
                % make
                ...lots of output...
                %
        command and wait.

        You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
        directory by using the
                % make clean
                ...lots of output...
                %
        command.  To remove all of the above files, and also remove the
        Makefile and lib/config.h and config.status files, use the
                % make distclean
                ...lots of output...
                %
        command.

        The file etc/configure.ac is used to create configure by a GNU program
        called autoconf.  You only need to know this if you want to regenerate
        configure using a newer version of autoconf.

TESTING FSTRCMP
        The fstrcmp package comes with a test suite.  To run this test suite,
        use the command
                % make sure
                ...lots of output...
                Passed All Tests
                %

        The tests take a fraction of a second each, with most very fast, and a
        couple very slow, but it varies greatly depending on your CPU.

        If all went well, the message
                Passed All Tests
        should appear at the end of the make.

INSTALLING FSTRCMP
        As explained in the SITE CONFIGURATION section, above, the fstrcmp
        package is installed under the /usr/local tree by default.  Use the
        --prefix=PATH option to configure if you want some other path.  More
        specific installation locations are assignable, use the --help option
        to the configure script for details.

        All that is required to install the fstrcmp package is to use the
                % make install
                ...lots of output...
                %
        command.  Control of the directories used may be found in the first
        few lines of the Makefile file and the other files written by the
        configure script; it is best to reconfigure using the configure
        script, rather than attempting to do this by hand.
