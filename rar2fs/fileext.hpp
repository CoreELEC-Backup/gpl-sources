    This is an extension of the freeware Unrar C++ library (libunrar).
    It requires the complete unrar source package in order to compile.

    Unrar source may be used in any software to handle RAR archives
    without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used to re-create
    the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary. Distribution
    of modified Unrar source in separate form or as a part of other
    software is permitted, provided that it is clearly stated in
    the documentation and source comments that the code may not be used
    to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
