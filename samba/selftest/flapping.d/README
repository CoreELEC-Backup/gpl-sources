# Files in this directory contain lists of regular expressions
# matching the names of tests that are that are flapping. In other
# words, they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail, depending on
# external factors.
#
# "make test" will not report failures or successes for tests listed here.
#
# DO NOT ADD TESTS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE ACTUALLY FLAPPING
#
# It is much better to add known failing tests to 'knownfail', so the
# test system can warn when they actually start passing.
#
# Empty lines and lines begining with '#' are ignored.
# Please don't add tests to this README!
