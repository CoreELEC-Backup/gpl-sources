dbus-glib is a deprecated D-Bus binding for GLib.

dbus-glib receives minimal maintenance and security fixes for the benefit
of projects like Telepathy and NetworkManager that still rely on it, but
should not be used in new projects (and existing projects should try
to move away from it, too). Please use GDBus, part of GLib since 2.26.
