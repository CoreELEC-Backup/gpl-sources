                <h3>How it works:</h3>

                <P>
                  While the computer serial device is open and idle,
                  DTR is negative w.r.t.&nbsp;GND and the large 4000
                  &micro;F capacitor gets full charge through D2 and
                  the 2k2 resistor in a few seconds.  Meanwhile, the
                  input to the NPN transistor remains blocked thanks
                  to D1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As IR commands are sent to the serial device,
                  positive pulses arrive to DTR.  These pulses have no
                  effect onto the capacitor, since they are now
                  blocked by D2.  While the capacitor has enough
                  charge, it powers the couple of NPN/PNP transistors,
                  which behave as a simple conventional pulse current
                  amplifier.  They yield enough (pulsed) current to
                  the pair of infra-red diodes to allow mid-range
                  operation; typically beyond 5 meters.  The
                  (optional) red LED and 0.5k resistor are intended
                  for visual monitoring of the outgoing IR bursts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Obviously, the current pulses tend to quickly
                  discharge the capacitor, but 4000 &micro;F can hold
                  enough charge for regular typical operation with
                  most IR commands, even in those cases where bursts
                  are repeatedly sent while
                  button-pressed. Fortunately enough, even in these
                  repeated-burst situations, the serial device is in
                  fact idle most of the time, thereby allowing the
                  capacitor to recover its charge and be prepared for
                  powering new pulse bursts.
                </p>

                <h3>Notes:</h3>
                <p>
                  Any type of low/medium-power diodes and transistors
                  are suitable.  The only critical components (apart
                  from the IR diodes themselves) are the two voltage
                  offset diodes. These diodes are marked as
                  "silicon", meaning that they must be "normal"
                  silicon diodes, which have a significant offset
                  voltage (+0.7 volt, approx.).  Other kinds of diodes
                  (e.g., germanium diodes) may have much lower offset
                  and are inadequate for the intended purpose.
                  Tolerances are not critical for any component of
                  this circuit (&plusmn;10% or even &plusmn;20% should
                  be ok).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, the range depends on how much power is
                  applied to drive the IR diodes and of the type of
                  diodes themselves.  I have tested several kinds of
                  IR diodes (intended for standard remotes) with no
                  much difference.  As to the power, it depends on two
                  main factors: a) the value of the (22 Ohm) resistor
                  from GND to the emitter of the PNP transistor and b)
                  the large (4000 &micro;F) capacitor.  The range can
                  always be increased by lowering the value of the
                  resistor (and/or adding more IR diodes) but than the
                  value of capacitor needs to be increased
                  correspondingly.
