 <center><h1>FTDI driver.</h1></center>

<p>
The FTDI driver is a MODE2 driver capable of both sending and receiving
data. It handles devices based on the FTDI chip e. g., as described
<a href="http://www.huitsing.nl/irftdi/">here</a>. It is based on the
<a href="http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/">libftdi</a>
library.</p>

<p>lirc also includes another driver for FTDI devices called
<a href="ftdix.html">ftdix</a>.  See <a href="ftdix.html">this page</a> for a
comparison</p>

<p>
By default, it searches for an usb device with <i>vendor:product</i>
matching 0x0403:0x6001. This can be changed using the device argument
which is a comma-separated string of <i>key=value</i> assignments.
The available keys are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>vendor: Numeric idVendor value[0403]</li>
    <li>product: Numeric idVendor value [6001]</li>
    <li>serial: Numeric idSerial value [*]</li>
    <li>input: input pin [1]</li>
    <li>output: output pin [2]</li>
    <li>baud: rx wire speed [9600]</li>
    <li>txbaud: tx wire speed [65536]</li>
</ul>
<p>
The driver has support for listing available devices using e. g.,
using <i>mode2 -l </i></p>
<p>
There has been a long-standing bug in this driver which effectively
has been using wrong timings. As of 0.10-0, this bug is fixed; however,
this breaks existing lircd.conf files. Users have the option of using
the driver option <i>old-timings</i> (the value does not matter) e. g.,
<code>-A old-timings:1</code>. This option is a transition helper and
will be removed in a future release.

The proper fix for a broken lircd.conf file is to use one of the following methods:
<ol>
  <li>
    Find a lircd.conf file for your remote in the
    <a href="http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html">remotes database</a>.
    You may need to update your .lircrc file if any of the button names are different.
  </li>
  <li>Update the timing parameters in your existing lircd.conf file.
    This method is not suitable for files with raw_codes definitions.
    New timings can be obtained from several sources
    <ul>
       <li>a lircd.conf file for your remote (or one that uses the same
           protocol) from the
           <a href="http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html">remotes database</a>.
          </li>
       <li>configure the driver without the old-timings option and use
           irrecord to record the remote. There is no need to record any
           buttons, just press enter and finish.</li>
       <li>use the timing data from the existing lircd.conf file and
           divide each value by 2.</li>
    </ul>
    Open the existing lircd.conf file and the new timings lircd.conf in a
    text editor.  Find the line 'begin remote', below this there will be
    lines with some of the following names
    <br><b>header, three, two, one, zero, ptrail, plead, foot, repeat, pre,
        post, gap, repeat_gap.</b>
    <br>Not all of these will be present in any particular lircd.conf file.
    Replace these with the equivalent from the new file. If you are using the
    divide by 2 method just update the value, some parameters have 2 values,
    both need to be updated.
  </li>
  <li>For lircd.conf files with raw_codes the only way is to configure
      the driver without the old-timings option and use irrecord to
      re-record the remote.
  </li>
</ol>
