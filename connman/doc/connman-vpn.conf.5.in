.SH NAME
connman-vpn.conf \- ConnMan-VPN configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @sysconfdir@/connman/connman-vpn.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.B connman-vpn.conf
is a configuration file for ConnMan-VPN. The configuration file is
optional but it can be used to set up various aspects of ConnMan-VPN's
behavior. The location of the file may be changed through use of
the \fB\-\-config= \fRargument for \fBconnman-vpn\fP(8).
.P
DAC privileges (user, group and supplementary groups) of a VPN binary
ran by \fBconnman-vpn\fP(8) can be controlled by this configuration.
Configuration in
.B connman-vpn.conf
is for all VPN types and can be overridden by defining separate configs into
.B @sysconfdir@/connman/vpn-plugin/
using the plugin name + .conf suffix using the same syntax. For example,
for OpenVPN the path to config is
.B  @sysconfdir@/connman/vpn-plugin/openvpn.conf
which will override any value in the main configuration.

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.P
The configuration file consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.
Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed
in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section
or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.

Description of sections and available keys follows:
.SS [General]
This section is the only mandatory section of the configuration file.
.TP
.BI InputRequestTimeout= secs

like passphrase will timeout after certain amount of time. Use this setting
to increase the value in case of different user interface designs.
