MTPFS
--------

MTPFS is a FUSE filesystem based on libmtp that allows a mtp device
to be browsed as if it were a normal external harddisk

Requirements
------------

FUSE >= 2.2
GLib >= 2.30
libmtp >= 1.1.2

How to mount a filesystem
-------------------------

To mount a device run:

  mtpfs <mount_point>

To unmount do:

  fusermount -u <mount_point>

Note that you may need to be root to do all this if permissions on the
MTP device are not correct

Debugging
---------
To enable debugging info use the --enable-debug option when running ./configure

Acknowledgements
----------------
This wouldn't be possible without libmtp, libusb and fuse.
Sections of code (in id3read.c and mp3file.c) blatently ripped from gnomad
