1.0.0 - Oct 11 1998 - Hessu

	Initial release.

1.1.0 - Jun 30 2001 - Hessu
	
	The odd maintenance update:
	
	With patches from both Colas Nahaboo <Colas@Nahaboo.com> and
	Godmar Back <gback@cs.utah.edu>, support for MODE2/2352 images
	(offset 24, 2048 byte data) has been fixed. I also added the
	-p option to get around with PSX tracks (untested, no reports,
	but this is what the original FireBurner source seems to do).
	
	Tracks with unrecognized mode are saved with extension '.ugh'.
	A little  more error checking.
	
	Added WAV audio file output. The code that was added to do
	correct byte orders might make break compiling on some systems.
	Still works on Linux and Solaris (2.6, 2.8 tested).
	
	Added a man page, and 'make install' for systems with BSD install.

1.1.1 - Aug 7 2001 - Hessu
	
	Added error detection while reading the bin file. Patch from
	Oskar Liljeblad <osk@hem.passagen.se>, forwarded from the
	debian bug tracking system by Sam Powers <sam@oddbox.org>.
	
	psxtruncate was always enabled, thanks for the report go to
	Patrik Weiskircher <pat@icore.at>.
	
	Christian W. Zuckschwerdt <zany@triq.net> provided a fix for the
	.spec file - replaced hardcoded paths with macros so that the
	package will build on other distributions too.

1.2.0 - Jun 29 2004 - Hessu

	Included a man page patch from the openbsd port of bchunk (adding
	a note about ISO/VCD), and s/ISO9110/ISO9660/. The changes were
	for openbsd by Dave Watson <dave@elephantride.org>.
	
	Patch from Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au> for a new option
	-r, which makes binchunker output MODE2/2352 tracks in raw format,
	from offset 0 for 2352 bytes.
