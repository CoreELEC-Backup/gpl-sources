  * Options parsing (notably -U) and just listing first remote
    bugs in irsimsend have been fixed.

0.9.2 12/09/14
  * Documentation fixes

0.9.2pre3  12/04/14
  * Add fix for #70, by mistake omitted in pre2.

0.9.2pre2  11/30/14
  * Fixes for #67 - #75 besides #71 and #74.

0.9.2pre1  11/21/14
  * Removed functionality:
    + The smode2 program has been retired from the build, although it still
      is available in contrib/.
    + The setup.sh script is removed (build always builds all drivers).
  * Drivers are loaded dynamically. Many programs including lircd now
    needs to know where the drivers are located to be able to use
    them. There are new options, environment variables and hard-coded
    defaults. See the manpages for more.
  * A new tool lirc-lsplugins is added to inspect dynamic driver modules.
  * New, unstable configuration script lirc-setup. The script guides user
    when selecting both capture device and remote config. It sports auto-
    detection of most devices, searching and downloading from the remotes
    database and a considerable amount of bugs.
  * The remotes/ directory has become obsolete, only used for testing.
    New configuration tools uses the remotes database at
    http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes as the only source (#53). A new tool
    irdb-get(1) supports searching and downloading from remotes database.
  * Building on MacOSX has been refreshed.
  * New devices and features:
    + Support for the Dangerous Prototypes irtoy device is added (#20).
    + Support for for sonyir on MacOSX is added. This is a single hiddev
      device; with the framework in place hopefully more devices will be
      added over time.
    + Support for the DIY assembly kit yard2 usb ir device is added. This is
      an experimental driver which depends on a server which currently is not
      packaged in any major distro; a Debian/Ubuntu PPA is available.
    + Support for the Roku remote protocol added (#8).
    + Support for long keypresses has been added. See the "Configuring LIRC"
      chapter in the manual, search for "ignore_first_event" (#50).
  * lircd has been verified to run as regular user as long as it can open
    devices and such. A new option --effective-user makes lircd drop it's
    privileges after opening devices if started as root. A new udev rule
    is shipped to make /dev/lirc* accessible for users in group 'lirc" (#56).
  * Logging runtime option is renamed: debug -> loglevel. Levels can be given
    symbolically e. g., 'info' or 'error'. Old option name is still supported.
  * Configuration changes
    + The default location for the user lircrc-file has been changed from
      ~/.lircrc to ~/.config/lircrc. The old location is still used as fallback.
      (ticket #52).
    + The lircd.conf configuration has been updated. lircd will now besides
      the lircd.conf file also read all *.conf files in the
      /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d directory. The already existing include directive
      has been modified to accept wildcards and also been documented.
    + lircd.conf has a new 'driver' attribute for configs requiring a specific
      driver. Supported by irrecord(1), used by lirc-setup(1) and irdb-get(1).
    + Mechanisms to disable the implicit sorting of remotes has been added,
      and the automatic sorting has been enhanced (ticket #56).
    + The enabling of lircrcd mode synchronization daemon has been changed. The
      old "#! lircrcd" shebang is deprecated and a new, global lircrc option
      "lircrc_class" is added (#62). The lircrcd sockets has been moved to
      /var/run/lirc (#61). This might break some corner-case installations.
  * Dependencies:
      + Build scripts now requires python3.
      + Build requires the pkg-config package, in particular
        /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4
      + python3-PyYAML is strongly recommended. lirc builds without it, but
        crippled (no table.html or lirc.hwdb, lirc-setup doesn't work).
      + Doxygen is required to build api docs (ignored if missing).
      + man2html is required to generate html manpages (the bundled version
        is dropped). If missing, no html manpages are generated.
      + lirc-setup requires gtk3 libraries and python3-gobject bindings,
        these are not required to build.
      + help2man is no longer required.
      + kernel sources are not required.
  * New configure options:
      --with-systemdsystemunitdir=... Installation path for systemd files
        (ticket #49).
      --with-lockdir=... Serial lock directory, /var/lock or /var/lockdev
        (ticket #44).
      --enable-python3-fix: Install python3 wrapper to actual python3.x
        version, bug walk-around for MacOSX.
  * Several options to configure have been dropped:
      --with-syslog: Logging defaults to using syslog, but using
        the --logfile runtime option switches to file loggging.
      --enable-debug: All builds have debug enabled.
      --daemonize: Always enabled.
      --enable-sandboxed: Devices are created in runtime.
      --with-driver=... The build always builds all drivers
      --enable-maintainer-mode: lircd.simsend and lircd.simrec
        (test tools) are always created although not installed.
  * Installation changes.
    + The so-version of the liblirc library is bumped, backwards-compatible.
    + The lircd and lircmd sockets are not created at installation any more,
      they are created on demand by the servers. If there already is e. g., a
      /var/run/lirc/lircd socket it will still be used without changing
      permissions (#46).
    + The long-standing issues with parallel make are fixed.
    + Many more files are installed in the data directory e. g., configuration
      files and a local copy of the lirc.org website.
    + Old, non-functional kernel modules are removed.
    + The configuration data which was in several places including
      configure.ac and setup.data is now in the configs/ directory.
  * API and programming features.
    + Support for sending data has been added to the lirc_client.h API.
      (ticket #35).
    + lirc now installs three separate libraries: lirc_private (internal),
      lirc (for external applications) and lirc_driver for drivers. Each
      library has a so-file to link to, a  header file for compilation
      and a pkg-config .pc file for build. Applications  and drivers have
      been refactored to use the libraries.
    + The hard-coded socket used by the lirc_client API can now be
      tweaked using LIRC_SOCKET_PATH environment variable (ticket #31).
    + There are examples in the sources how to build new drivers. The
      documentation in this area is also improved (see the driver-api guide
      and doc/api-docs).
    + The doc/ directory has support for creating doxygen API documentation.
  * Test overhaul: new unit tests available in test/. New test tools
    irsimsend and irsimreceive which works without lircd. The
    lirc-codec-regression-test script has been updated.

0.9.1 06/14/14
  * Added systemd support: unit files, socket activation.
  * Default config files are installed in /etc, use --install-etc to disable.

    <maacruz@navegalia.com>)
  * added support for ProVideo PV951 (Bogdan Gaspar)
  * added support for Creative Infra receiver (PC-DVD remote, Stephen White)
  * major changes to the SIR driver, if you used this driver before
    you may have to generate new config files for your remotes
  * Tekram Irmate 210 support (receiving only, EXPERIMENTAL)
    range is really lousy (<10 cm) for some remotes, works best with
    RECS80 remotes due to the short pulses this protocol uses

    Hans-Hermann Redenius for contributing a device.
  * Konrad Riedel has added support for CARACA (caraca.sourceforge.net)
  * added min_repeat option to lircd.conf
    Some remotes (e.g. Sony) send the IR codes several times if you
    press a button even though you don't hold the button down. This
    new option tells lircd how often it should send a code
    additionally to the first code. In order to send the code three
    times altogether you have to set min_repeat to 2.

0.6.1: 07/21/00
  * added support for PCTV (pro) receiver by Pinnacle Systems (Bart Alewijnse)
  * lircd now can be configured to use syslogd for log output
    Thanks to Rainer Clasen for the suggestion.
  * irexec has a --daemon option to easily start it from an init script
    Thanks to Eric Crahen for the suggestion.
  * added RC-MM support
  * added RC-6 support
  * added support for Slink-e by Nirvis Systems (Max Spring)
  * added duty_cycle option to lircd.conf
  * hardware is only initialized if clients have connected to lircd
    That way modules don't have to be loaded until they are really
    needed. Thanks to Gilles Chanteperdrix for suggestion and patches.
  * added support for the following TV cards:
    Hauppauge, AVerMedia, Fly Video 98, Pixelview PlayTV pro
  * added hardware abstraction layer for TV cards (Artur Lipowski
    <lipowski@comarch.pl>)

0.6.0: 04/02/00
  * SMP support for serial port driver
  * Milan Pikula has provided a driver for the SIR (serial infrared)
    mode of IrDA ports available in many notebooks
  * lirc_client is now a library
  * irxevent: new keyword:
     xy_Key <x_position> <y_position> [modifiers-]<key> <windowname>
  * finally added support of shift-encoded remotes to irrecord
  * got rid of lirmand, you no longer need it!
    if you update from lirc-0.5.4 you might want to modify the value
    of gap in your config file to make repeats work (or just record
    everything again)
  * added new feature to .lircrc config file:
    a program with name 'progname' will startup in mode 'progname' if
    such a mode is defined
  * now works on Alphas
  * added very simple noise filter to serial port driver
  * added TOGGLE_ACTIVATE directive to lircmd
  * renamed examples to contrib, added Debian 2.1 Slink init script
  * cleaned up lircmd.c
  * fixed bug in lirc_nextir()
  * implemented extended C escape codes in .lircrc
  * added IMPS/2 protocol to lircmd
  * fixed signal bug in lircd, lircmd
  * cleaned up parallel port driver: works great
  * reversed order of ChangeLog and renamed to NEWS
  * deleted all those nice new 0.5.4 Makefiles...
    we now do automake and autoconf (Tom Wheeley)
  * fixed memory leak in read_config()
  * read_config(): parser recognizes garbage at the end of valid lines
  * irrecord.c: 'begin','end' and names beginning with '#' are not allowed
    as button name
  * changed decoding code as last bit of pulse encoded remotes (e.g. SONY)
    can be significant
  * irrecord.c: small fix to make NO_HEAD_REP work
  * started to add support for TV cards
  * parport support for parallel port driver in 2.2.x kernels
    As I don't plan to upgrade my Linux box to 2.2.x very soon this code
    will stay untested until then.
  * lircd accepts some list commands, an example will be implemented in
    the next version of xrc; lircd sends a 'SIGHUP' string to all clients
    on SIGHUP
  * added new flag to support remote controls that also send a header
    before repeat codes


0.5.4: 02/26/99
  * fixed misbehaviour when header and repeat code is equal
  * added new flag to support AIWA remote controls correctly
  * parser is more pedantic regarding numbers
  * fixed a bug parsing flags
  * LONG_IR_CODE is now default
    There are more remote controls that send >32 bits than I thought.
  * fixed some bugs in sending code
  * minor changes to decoding code, I hope that everything else is still
    working
  * record now can convert config files in raw mode into normal config
    files
    These config files are much smaller and consume less memory.
    This is still experimental and will only work for space encoded remote
    controls.
  * added repeat_gap to support AnimaX remote controls correctly (only
    sending is affected)
  * As there have been some changes to the decoding code, I have added some
    code to simulate any remote control as long as I have a config file
    for it.
    So now I am quite sure that everything is still working with the
    already known remote controls because I now can test it. :-)
  * merged the device driver with Ben Pfaff's driver
  * some things done by me (Karsten Scheibler)
    - added documentation
    - rewrite of the Makefiles to make installation somewhat easier
    - new directory structure
  * fixed a nasty bug in serial port device driver
  * fixed sense autodetection problem in serial device driver (thanks
    to Eric Lammerts for the patch)
  * changed the name of record program to irrecord to avoid name conflicts
  * fixed another bug in serial port device driver, we must autodetect
    sense before requesting the IRQ
  * documentation-update
  * fixed (I hope) problem with irq_handler in the serial port device driver
  * changes to the serial port device driver to support the Animax remote
    control correctly
  * added xmode2 and irxevent-0.4.2 to the tools directory (thanks to
    Heinrich Langos)


0.5.3: 11/23/98
  * changed type of ir_code to unsigned long for faster decoding on
    32-bit architectures. Change the define in the Makefile to get the
    old setting.
  * removed some inlines to reduce code size
  * changed config file format for all application programs
    The most important new features are:
    - one config file for all lirc applications possible
      You can still have different config files.
    - toggle buttons possible
    - button sequences are supported
    - different modes available for e.g. cd, mpg, tv, etc.
  * new program: smode2


0.5.2: 10/20/98
  * This version has been done by Pablo d'Angelo and me (Chistoph)
  * (changed by pablo) changed the config-files format for every application
    in the apps directory.
    You can specify the remote within the config files. '*' are allowed as
    wildcards for button and remote now. (beware: the config file is parsed
    from bottom to top, in case you use button='*')
  * added ACTIVATE direcitve to lircmd config file
    There is an example config file in contrib/lircmd.conf now.
  * added some Philips remote controls (thanks to Per-Henrik Persson)
  * shift encoded remote contols now work!
  * Pablo has added config file support to lircd
    The old header files still can be used for compatibility.
    As the header files and the format of the config files might change in
    further versions (yes, it has changed again in this version) you are only
    on the safe side if you send me header/config files for your remote
    controls that are not already part of this package.
  * both lircd and lircmd will re-read their config files an SIGHUP
  * added support for "raw mode" remote controls to lircd
    The IR signals are not decoded. Instead the output of the device driver
    is just recorded and kind of pattern matching is being done to
    recognize a IR signal.
    There is a new program in apps:
    record will create a lircd config file for your remote control in raw mode
    This also will work with remote contorls that do not use a known
    protocol for sending IR signals. There might be some limitations on this
    I am not aware of at the moment, but the only problem I can think of now
    are remote controls that use a repeat bit.
    You can still record the IR signals twice for each state of the repeat bit.
    This will give you good enough results, but this is not an elegant
    solution.


0.5.1: 09/05/98
  * configureable mouse daemon
  * minor bugfixes


0.5.0: 09/02/98
  * this is a complete rewrite of the daemon done by me (Christoph)
  * cleaned up the whole package
  * removed mouse stuff from daemon, somebody has to write a configureable
    mouse daemon...
  * the daemon has been rewritten in plain C,
    this should be much better to read
  * there is support for sending again
    you can download the software for sending via lirc from my homepage
    at http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~columbus/lirc
  * the data structures for remotes have changed,
    adding new remotes should be much easier now
    at this time there is only support for my remote control
    further remote controls will be added if they are confirmed to work
    with the new header files
  * by default the daemon writes into a logfile in /var/log/lircd
  * added irxevent for sending events to X application
    from Heinrich Langos (heinrich@null.net)


0.4.1: 06/05/98
  * The structures for the different remotes have been moved into their own
    header files, in the directory remotes.  The file remotes.h controls
    which ones get compiled in.
  * An additional remote (panasonic) thanks to Tommy Thorn
  * Some updates to the docs
  * Somes changes to make shift encoded remotes work better.  They still
    don't work right.  I don't have one of these remotes, so there isn't
    much I can do.


0.4: 02/25/98
  * Not official, done by me (Trent)
  * new mode in kernel driver, easier to use and more stable
  * Use UNIX domain socket rather than TCP socket for daemon

  * misc other fixes/changes
  * no transmitting stuff....


0.3: 07/21/96
  * some support for transmitting
  * cleaned up ir_remote
  * readir replaced by record


0.2: 05/15/96
  * remote recognition more flexible
    for most remotes you only need to fill in a data table now
    see ir_remote.h and ir_remote.cc


0.1: 05/13/96
  * first release
