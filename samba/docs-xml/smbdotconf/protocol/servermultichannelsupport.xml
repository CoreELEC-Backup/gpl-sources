    Warning: Note that this feature is still considered experimental.
    Use it at your own risk: Even though it may seem to work well in testing,
    it may result in data corruption under some race conditions.
    Future releases may improve this situation.
    </para>

    <para>Due to dependencies to kernel APIs of Linux or FreeBSD, it's only possible
    to use this feature on Linux and FreeBSD for now. For testing this restriction
    can be overwritten by specifying <constant>force:server multi channel support=yes</constant>
    in addition.</para>
