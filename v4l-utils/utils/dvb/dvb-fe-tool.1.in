.SH NAME
dvb\-fe\-tool \- DVBv5 tool for frontend settings inspect/change
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvb\-fe\-tool
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
dvbv5\-fe\-tool is a command line tool for digital TV services that is compliant
with version 5 of the DVB API, and backward compatible with the older
v3 DVB API.
.PP
dvb\-fe\-tool is a tool to inspect and change the tuning parameters directly
at the Digital TV frontend. If called without any parameter, it will show
the device capabilities.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
The following options are valid:
.TP
\fB\-3\fR, \fB\-\-dvbv3\fR
Use DVBv3 only
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-adapter\fR=\fIADAPTER\fR
Digital TV adapter to use. Default: 0.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-acoustical\fR
beeps if signal quality is good. Also enables femon mode. Please notice that
console beep should be enabled on your wm.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-set\-delsys\fR=\fIPARAMS\fR
Sets delivery system to the one specified at \fIPARAMS\fR. use \fIhelp\fR to
show all supported delivery systems.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-frontend\fR=\fIFRONTEND\fR
Digital TV frontend to use. Default: 0.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-get\fR
Gets frontend parameters.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-femon\fR
Monitors the frontend locking status and the available statistics for a
frontend that it is already being streaming via some other application.
This opens the frontend on read-only mode.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Enables debug messages.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Outputs the usage help.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Gives a short usage message.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints program version.
.SH EXIT STATUS
On success, it returns 0.
.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
.SS Showing device capabilities
This is the default behavior. It will open the frontend and show what
capabilities it supports and what's the version of the DVB API.

DVB API Version 5.10, Current v5 delivery system: DVBC/ANNEX_A
Supported delivery systems:
    [DVBC/ANNEX_A]
     DVBC/ANNEX_C
     DVBT
.fi
.SS Setting the delivery system
Some devices (like the above example) supports multiple delivery systems.
Older DVB applications might not be able to switch from one delivery system
to another one, as this feature were added only on DVB API version 5.5.
.PP
This feature allows one to use those legacy applications.
.PP
.nf
$ \fBdvb\-fe\-tool \-d dvbc/annex_c\fR
Changing delivery system to: DVBC/ANNEX_C
.fi
.SS Getting the current frontend settings
.PP
The tool can also be used to get the current settings. In this case, it will
open the frontend at read-only mode, allowing it to be called while some other
digital TV application is running.
.PP
.nf
$ \fBdvb\-fe\-tool \-g\fR
FREQUENCY = 573000000
MODULATION = QAM/256
INVERSION = AUTO
SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
INNER_FEC = NONE
DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
.fi
.SS Monitoring the frontend
.PP
The dvb\-fe\-tool can also be used to monitor a DVB frontend statistics
without touching on the device, using the \-\-femon (or \-m) parameter.
The typical usage is to be able to read the statistics while some other
DVB program or application is in use.
.PP
On this mode, it will keep printing the frontend statistics on every second,
until the program is aborted with CTRL\-C:
.PP
For example, while dvbv5\-zap is tuning some channel, it will produce:
.PP
.nf

.PP
If the standard error device is the console, the messages will be colored
according with the signal quality.
.PP
The presented statistics types and unities will depend on the ones that the
hardware you're using support. So, it may vary from hardware to hardware.
.PP
On this mode, it also supports to output an audible signal if the quality is
good, using the '\-A' parameter.
.PP
Please notice that, on modern Linux systems, the system audio should be
enabled at your window manager and the audio theme should be set to produce
an audio when BELL (\fIcharacter\fP) is sent to the terminal.
.SS NOTE:
C/N on the above stats means Carrier to Noise ratio. This is the Signal to
Noise ratio measured at the pilot carrier or just the Signal to Noise ratio
for modulation types where just one carrier is used, like DVB-C or DVB-S.
