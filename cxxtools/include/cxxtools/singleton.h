        @param T Type of the singleton
        @param A Allocator for type T

        The Singleton class template can be used to easily implement the Singleton
        design pattern. It can either be used directly or as a base class. An
        allocator can be used to control how the singleton instance will be
        allocated.

        The follwing example shows how to use the singleton as a base class:
        @code
              class MySingleton : public Singleton<MySingleton>
              {
                   friend class Singleton<MySingleton>;

                   // ...
               };
        @endcode
     */

                    When called for the first time, the singleton instance will be
                    created with the specified alloctaor. All subsequent calls wikk
                    return a reference to the previously created instance.
