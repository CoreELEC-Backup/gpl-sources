.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Iso9660 Analyzer Tool is a free utility tool for detecting the structure of DVD/CD-ROM image file formats; the tool supports many DVD/CD-ROM data image file formats.\n 

\n \tThe following are the supported modes\n

\t\t1)	MODE1/2048

\t\t2)	MODE1/2368

\t\t3)	MODE1/2352

\t\t4)	MODE1/2448

\t\t5)	MODE2/2336

\t\t6)	MODE2/2352

\n\tThe following are not supported.\n

\t1) The compressed image format eg: zlib images, audio\n
       
Iso9660 Analyzer Tool provides the conversion of any image format to an UDF/ISO 
for easy mounting in your favorite Operating System. The tool also permits the 
creation of TOC or CUE file descriptor to burn the image easily with your favorite 
burner on your favorite Operating System. If the image is not compliant with TOC or CUE, 
it should be converted to UDF/ISO format which can be mounted upon any Operating System.

If the Operating System does not support image of DVD/CD-ROM, then creating the TOC file 
descriptor is a good option burn 1:1 original image. Iso9960 Analyzer Tool provides option 
to create TOC file descriptor. Note some application does not support TOC descriptor.
Similarly, if the Operating System does not support image of DVD/CD-ROM, then creating 
the CUE file descriptor is also a good option. Iso9960 Analyzer Tool provides option to 
create CUE file descriptor. Note the creation of CUE might work with protected image.

.SH OPTIONS
Option Syntax\n

Iso9660  Analyzer  tool  uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has both the long and short form. Long options  are  more  convenient to remember, but shorter are easier to type. The user may freely mix different option styles, or specify  options  after  the command-line arguments.\n

eg.:\n

               iat --iso --input=FOO.img -o FOO.iso\n

The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.  Instead of -o log you can write -oFOO.iso\n

Many options that do  not  require  arguments  may be clubed together\n
	

eg.:\n

              iat -xi FOO.img\n

The equivalent is\n

              iat -x -i FOO.img\n

.SH BUGS
You are welcome to submit bug reports via the Iso9660 Analyzer Tool bug tracker (see
<https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6784>).

Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

1.  Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.If iat crashes, it's a bug.  If iat does not behave as documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to double-check the documentation and the
mailing lists.

2.  Please reproduce the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  eg. if iat crashes during the conversion operation

	iat --toc -i FOO.img -o FOO 

try to reproduce the  crash,  and  if  reproduced, use simpler set of options to reproduce the bug.
                

3.  Please use iat with --debug  option and send us the resulting output

	iat --debug -i FOO.img > FOO.log

Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information from the debug log before sending it to the bug address.  

4.  If iat has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. "gdb"
