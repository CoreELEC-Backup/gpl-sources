libhid swig README
==================

libhid can be used from Python thanks to Swig[0]. We do not provide any
additional documentation at this point.

The libhid Python API is exactly the same as the C API.

To build the swig python bindins, you need swig 1.3.

You can expect further information on the project website

  http://libhid.alioth.debian.org

when we found the time to provide some.

Also, if you are interested in other language bindings generated by swig,
please contact us at libhid@lists.ailab.ch.
