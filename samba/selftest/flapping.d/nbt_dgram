# following SMB1/SMB2 test env split it seems this test
# fails randomly however it doesn't seem to be directly
# related to the changes (e.g. not protocl negotiation
# specific) Best guess is the order of test having being
# changed (as a result of test moving env) or some other
# strange env related side affect is causing this.
