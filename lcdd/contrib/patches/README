What do these patches do ?
==========================

1. HKEY - Hybrid Right/Left Key option in LCDd.conf

If selected, the same config works on 4 or 6 key pads, any key wakes up 
the menus, the keys behave a bit more intuitively and if you have a menu 
w/ only ring or slider you can't get stuck in them on a 4 key system. 
Ultimately, I wonder if the key processing could be simplified a bit, it 
currently has 3 levels, that might be able to be flattened, I've been 
pondering it and don't have a simple sol'n yet, but feel like there's 
one there, so I'll keep thinking on it for now.

2. OPT - adds options to the LCDd.conf for
* storing the default display string on the CFontz633.c, we use this to 
  put up a "starting" message for reboot for example.
  CFontz633 boot messages can use both lines of the display: if you
  specify a message longer than 16 characters, the second line gets set
  to characters 17+.
* setting the main menu name - which show's up on the LCD menu list, we 
  give it a more meaningful name like "admin" for the menus, instead of 
  "lcdproc"
  Now doesn't display empty menus - if you disabled the default LCDd
  server menu (one of the features of the patch), you could still enter
  the menus, but it would crash if you pressed the right arrow.  It also
  looked pretty funny.  I figured the safest and easiest thing to do was
  just to not display a useless menu.
  Let the server menu name be configurable in the config file with the
  [menu]menuentryname="Menu Name" option in LCDd.conf.

3. SEG - adds the ability to get a stack trace for the LCDd daemon. I 
didn't actually catch a useful trace w/ it, but might be a nice 
diagnostic ability or not worth the trouble, maybe gdb's just easier 
when you need?
