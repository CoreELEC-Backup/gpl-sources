.TH VMSTAT 8 "September 2011" "procps-ng" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
vmstat \- Report virtual memory statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmstat
[options]
.RI [ delay " [" count ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmstat
reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, disks
and cpu activity.
.PP
The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.  Additional
reports give information on a sampling period of length
.IR delay .
The process and memory reports are instantaneous in either case.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I delay
The
.I delay
between updates in seconds.  If no
.I delay
is specified, only one report is printed with the average values since boot.
.TP
.I count
Number of updates.  In absence of
.IR count ,
when
.I delay
is defined, default is infinite.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-active\fR
Display active and  inactive memory, given a 2.5.41 kernel or better.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-forks\fR
The
.B \-f
switch displays the number of forks since boot.  This includes the fork,
vfork, and clone system calls, and is equivalent to the total number of tasks
created.  Each process is represented by one or more tasks, depending on
thread usage.  This display does not repeat.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-slabs\fR
Displays slabinfo.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-one-header\fR
Display the header only once rather than periodically.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stats\fR
Displays a table of various event counters and memory statistics.  This
display does not repeat.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-disk\fR
Report disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required).
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disk-sum\fR
Report some summary statistics about disk activity.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR \fIdevice\fR
Detailed statistics about partition (2.5.70 or above required).
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-unit\fR \fIcharacter\fR
Switches outputs between 1000
.RI ( k ),
1024
.RI ( K ),
1000000
.RI ( m ),
or 1048576
.RI ( M )
bytes.  Note this does not change the block (bi/bo) fields, which are always
measured in blocks.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timestamp\fR
Append timestamp to each line
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wide\fR
Wide output mode (useful for systems with higher amount of memory,
where the default output mode suffers from unwanted column breakage).
The output is wider than 80 characters per line.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help and exit.

.SH NOTES
.B "vmstat "
does not require special permissions.
.PP
These reports are intended to help identify system bottlenecks.  Linux
.B vmstat
does not count itself as a running process.
.PP
All linux blocks are currently 1024 bytes.  Old kernels may report blocks as
512 bytes, 2048 bytes, or 4096 bytes.
.PP
Since procps 3.1.9, vmstat lets you choose units (k, K, m, M).  Default is K
(1024 bytes) in the default mode.
.PP
vmstat uses slabinfo 1.1
