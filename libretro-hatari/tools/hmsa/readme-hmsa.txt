NAME
       hmsa - Atari MSA / ST disk image creator and converter

SYNOPSIS
       hmsa diskimage [disksize]

DESCRIPTION
       Hmsa  is  little  program  to create compressed Atari MSA (Magic Shadow
       Archiver) and uncompressed ST disk images and to  convert  disk  images
       between these two formats.

       MSA and ST image format saving code is same as in Hatari itself.

USAGE
       If  you give only one parameter, the file name of an existing MSA or ST
       disk image, this image will be converted to the other disk image format
       under a suitable new file name.

       If the file does not exist and you give also a disk size:

       SS     Single Sided (360KB)

       DS     Double Sided (720KB)

       HD     High Density (1.44MB)

       ED     Extended Density (2.88MB)

       An empty disk of the given size will be created.

       Disk  image  format  is  recognized  based  on  the file name extension
       (either .msa or .st).

EXAMPLES
       Create a normal double sided empty ST disk image:
            hmsa blank.st DS

       Convert an MSA format disk image to an ST format one:
            hmsa disk.msa

SEE ALSO
       Hmsa is part of hatari.
