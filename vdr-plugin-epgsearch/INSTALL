Theres nothing special about it. Install it like any other standard
plugin (unpack, soft link, make plugins).

Optional libraries:
-------------------

libpcre
-------
For support of Perl compatible regular expressions in a search you have to use
libpcre:
simply edit the plugins Makefile and uncomment '#REGEXLIB = pcre' to
'REGEXLIB = pcre' or append 'REGEXLIB=pcre' to your 'make plugins'
call. (you will need pcreposix installed, comes with libpcre from
www.pcre.org, but it's already part of most distributions
HINT: if all compiles well, but after starting VDR you get:

ERROR: /usr/lib/libpcreposix.so.0: undefined symbol: pcre_free).

update libpcre from www.pcre.org and recompile the plugin.

There seems to be a problem with PCRE on some systems, that produce a crash
when using regexp. Til now, I could not find the reason. So perhaps dont use
REGEXLIB=pcre, if you don't really need it.

libtre
------
epgsearch has a fuzzy search algorithm. Unfortunately it's restricted to
search patterns with a maximum of 31 characters. This results in empty results
if more than 31 characters are used. To avoid this limitation you can use the
TRE package (http://laurikari.net/tre/). Install tre (on debian:
apt-get install tre-agrep libtre4 libtre-dev) and activate epgsearch's support
for it in the Makefile by uncommenting '#REGEXLIB = pcre' to 'REGEXLIB = tre' or append
it to your 'make plugins' call. After recompiling epgsearch will now use an
algorithm similar to 'agrep' with no limits.
