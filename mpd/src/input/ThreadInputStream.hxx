 *
 * This works only for "streams": unknown length, no seeking, no tags.

 * The implementation must call Stop() before its destruction
 * completes.  This cannot be done in ~ThreadInputStream() because at
 * this point, the class has been morphed back to #ThreadInputStream
 * and the still-running thread will crash due to pure method call.
