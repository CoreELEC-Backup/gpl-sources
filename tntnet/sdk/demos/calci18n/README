This demonstrates the i18n-feature of tntnet. Although this is a nice feature,
the handling is somewhat ugly and may change in future releases. What I don't
like is format the translations. Currently the system expects the original text
and translated text separated by a tab-character. It is always bad habit to
give tab-characters a special meaning. It would be better to have some more
readable representation.

Maybe something like this:

    text="Calculator"
    translation="Rechner"
    text="Tommi's Tnt-Calculator"
    translation="Tommi's Rechner"

This give us the chance to add comments into the text, if needed, which is
always a good idea.

It is only a problem in handling the sources and therefore no real problem.
When a new format is specified, a simple translation e.g. with awk is easily
performed and will be either deliverer as a script or the old format will be
supported with some special flag to ecppll (which is rather likely, because
tab-separated files are really simple to parse). Comments are welcome.
