	#    packets are sent from the "wrong" ip address, something linux

	# 2, Some clients only accept statd packets IFF they come from the
	#    'correct' ip address.

	#    specify the 'correct' hostname in the statd packet.
	#    Some clients require both the correct source address and also the
	#    correct name. (these clients also ONLY work if the ip addresses
	#    used to map the share can be resolved into the name returned in
	#    the notify packet.)

	#    packet matches the ip address used to take out the lock.
	#    I.e. that the correct source address is used.
	#    These clients also require that the statd notify packet contains
	#    the name as the ip address used when the lock was taken out.

	# Both 2a and 2b are commonly used in lockmanagers since they maximize

	# not just ignore it.
