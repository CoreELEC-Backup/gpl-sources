Description:

Add epg info from epg sources into vdr. xmltv2vdr just imports data in
xmltv format which must be provided by an external source (please look
into the dist directory for sources)

Interface for sources:

All sources must provide a control file with a name similar to the
name of the source/source.xmltv (e.g. epgdata.xmltv -> epgdata).
In the first line you can decide if your source provides data by file 
(file must be placed in /var/lib/epgsources with extension .xmltv) or
pipe (binary with the same name is called by xmltv2vdr-plugin, and
must be in the path). There can be additional fields in the first 
line seperated with semicolons. The second option gives the time when
the epg data will be updated from the origin, the third option informs
the plugin, if a pin is needed for this source (0/1), the fourth option
is used to determine if the source is providing epgimages (files
must be placed in /var/lib/epgsources under a directory with a name
similar to the name of the source)
The second line shows the maximum days which will be provided.
The next lines are unique channelnames, provided by the source.
There can be application dependend data after each channelname. Note,
that the plugin/VDR must be able to read this control file.

See this link for an list of unique channelnames (and please report
if there should be more)
