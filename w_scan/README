Hi,

this is a small channel scan tool for vdr which generates ATSC, DVB-C, DVB-S/S2 and DVB-T channels.conf files.
It's based on old "scan" tool from linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0, the differences are:

- no initial tuning data needed, because scanning without this data is exactly
  what a scan tool like this should do
- it detects automatically which DVB/ATSC card to use
- much more output formats, interfacing to other dtv software.

1. Building w_scan
--------------------
Ususally not needed - w_scan is included as binary in this package.

1.a Using the autotools tool chain.
----------------------------------
If you really need to compile, just issue the usual

./configure
make
make install

NOTE: For compiling need up-to-date(!) dvb headers with DVB API 5.3 support
are needed. If configure fails complaining about missing or old DVB headers,
run in your kernel source 'make headers_install' 
(needs kernel 2.6.29 or higher (!) ).
At your choice you may also manually update this files; they're located
in /usr/include/linux/dvb.

1.b Using the cmake tool chain.
----------------------------------
You may also use the new cmake tool chain, but be warned - that tool chain is
new and experimental in w_scan up to now. It's intended to be used as

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

NOTE: cmake allows as ./configure does, a user defined install prefix.
      Use 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX> ..'. If you don't
      overwrite CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, w_scan will be installed with prefix=/usr.

2. Basic usage
--------------------

NOTE: Newer versions of w_scan need setting '-c' for specifying 
country (ATSC, DVB-C and DVB-T) or '-s' for satellite (DVB-S).


2.a. DVB-C (using Germany as country, option -c)
./w_scan -fc -c DE >> channels.conf

2.b. DVB-T
./w_scan -c DE >> channels.conf

2.c. DVB-C and DVB-T
./w_scan -c DE >> channels.conf && ./w_scan -fc -c DE >> channels.conf

2.d. ATSC (terrestrial, using United States as country)
./w_scan -fa -c US >> channels.conf

2.e. US Digital Cable (QAM Annex-B)
./w_scan -A2 -c US >> channels.conf

2.f. ATSC, both terrestrial and digital cable
./w_scan -A3 -c US >> channels.conf

2.g. DVB-S, here: Astra 19.2 east
./w_scan -fs -s S19E2

	NOTE: see './w_scan -s?' for list of satellites.

2.h. generate (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data
./w_scan -c DE -x > initial_tuning_data.txt

2.i. generate kaffeine-0.8.5 channels.dvb
./w_scan -c DE -k > channels.dvb

2.j. reformat output for UTF8
./w_scan <OPTIONS> | tcs -f 8859-1 > channels.conf

For more sophisticated scan options see ./w_scan -h.
