Hi. I'm Matthew Strait <quadong AT users DOT sf DOT net>. I didn't write
most of what you see here, but I created a sourceforge.net project for
it because the original author (Matthew Conte) didn't appear to be
contactable and I wanted to make some improvements. As such, I don't
understand how everything is done. Please see the README.* files for
more info.
