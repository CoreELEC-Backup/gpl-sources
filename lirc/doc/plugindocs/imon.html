                      With lirc 0.8.5 and earlier, iMON device support is a bit
                      lacking in feature-completeness, compared with Windows,
                      and for the newer devices, a pain for users to set up.
                    </P>

                      First up, many devices still need HID quirk overrides to
                      prevent the usbhid driver from claiming them before lirc
                      can. For starters, you need to determine the USB Vendor
                      and Device ID for you iMON device. Most devices have a
                      Vendor ID of 0x15c2. Device IDs are typically either
                      0xffdc or somewhere in the 0x0030 through 0x0046 range.
                      You should be able to see your IDs in the output of the
                      command 'lsusb'. For the purposes of this example, we'll
                      assume you have the 15c2:0045 device.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                      If your kernel has usbhid built as a module, then
                      the following in a modprobe config file (such as
                      /etc/modprobe.d/imon.conf) might be necessary:
                      <pre>
options usbhid quirks=0x15c2:0x0045:0x0004
                      </pre>

                      If your kernel has usbhid built-in, you may need to add
                      the quirk info to the your kernel boot parameters, like
                      so:
                      <pre>
usbhid.quirks=0x15c2:0x0045:0x4
                      </pre>

                      If you're lucky, your device has already been quirked
                      properly in the usbhid driver itself, but if not, please
                      let the lirc developers know, so they can submit patches
                      to the usbhid driver upstream. You can tell if its
                      necessary by grepping your dmesg output after booting up,
                      looking for USB HID and your Device ID, like so:
                      <pre>
$ dmesg |grep "USB HID.*15c2"
input,hidraw0: USB HID v1.01 Mouse [HID 15c2:0045] on usb-0000:00:02.0-2
hiddev96hidraw1: USB HID v1.00 Device [HID 15c2:0045] on usb-0000:00:02.0-2
                      </pre>

                      In the above, we can see that the usbhid driver has claimed
                      our iMON device, and manual quirk addition is required.

                    <P>
                      Newer devices have two USB IR endpoints, which lead to
                      lirc 0.8.5 and earlier setting up two lirc devices for
                      what was in fact a single device, and the two devices
                      had to be bound together in userspace, lest the input
                      buffer would get wedged if a button from the device
                      you weren't listening to wasn't serviced. So if you're
                      using lirc 0.8.5 or earlier, you'll need to start up
                      two lircd daemons, bound to one another, along these
                      lines:
                      <pre>
lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc0 --pidfile=/var/run/lirc0.pid --listen=8765
lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc1 --pidfile=/var/run/lirc1.pid --output=/dev/lircd --connect=localhost:8765
                      </pre>

                        Note that this requires some modification of
                        distribution-provided init scripts, manual startup or
                        what have you, in most cases. It really does work
                        though...

                    <P>
                      With post-0.8.5 lirc, the dual interface iMON devices
                      are handled as a single lirc device, greatly
                      simplifying setup for users -- distribution init
                      scripts should work out of the box. However, it may
                      still be necessary to manually add a quirk to keep
                      the usbhid driver from claiming your device.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                      In addition, post-0.8.5 lirc now includes mouse input
                      device support, so the keyboard/mouse toggle button
                      actually functions as one would expect it to (and as
                      it does under Windows). A special bonus not present
                      under Windows (I think) is that the ch+/- buttons
                      emulate a scroll wheel in mouse mode.

                      A lot of credit is due to Ron Frazier, for documenting
                      the necessary config for lirc 0.8.5 and earlier with
                      the newer iMON devices. See <a href="http://mythtvblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/getting-imon-0038-lcd-working-with-lirc.html" target="_blank">http://mythtvblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/getting-imon-0038-lcd-working-with-lirc.html</a>
