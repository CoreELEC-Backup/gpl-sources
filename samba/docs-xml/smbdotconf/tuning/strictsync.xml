    <para>This parameter controls whether Samba honors a request
    from an SMB client to ensure any outstanding operating system
    buffer contents held in memory are safely written onto stable
    storage on disk. If set to <constant>yes</constant>, which is
    the default, then Windows applications can force the smbd server
    to synchronize unwritten data onto the disk. If set to
    <constant>no</constant> then smbd will ignore client
    requests to synchronize unwritten data onto stable storage on
    disk.</para>

    <para>In Samba 4.7.0, the default for this parameter changed from
    <constant>no</constant> to <constant>yes</constant> to better
    match the expectations of SMB2/3 clients and improve application
    safety when running against smbd.</para>

    <para>The flush request from SMB2/3 clients is handled
    asynchronously inside smbd, so leaving the parameter as the default
    value of <constant>yes</constant> does not block the processing of
    other requests to the smbd process.</para>

    <para>Legacy Windows applications (such as the Windows 98 explorer
    shell) seemed to confuse writing buffer contents to the operating
    system with synchronously writing outstanding data onto stable storage
    on disk. Changing this parameter to <constant>no</constant> means that
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will ignore the Windows
    applications request to synchronize unwritten data onto disk. Only
    consider changing this if smbd is serving obsolete SMB1 Windows clients
    prior to Windows XP (Windows 98 and below). There should be no need to
    change this setting for normal operations.</para>
