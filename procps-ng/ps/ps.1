.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps\fR [\,\fIoptions\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ps
displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want
a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use
.IR top (1)
instead.
.P
This version of
.B ps
accepts several kinds of options:
.IP
.PD 0
.IP 1 4
UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
.IP 2 4
BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
.IP 3 4
GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.
.PD
.PP
Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.
There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to
the many standards and
.B ps
implementations that this
.B ps
is compatible with.
.P
Note that "\fBps \-aux\fR" is distinct from "\fBps\ aux\fR".  The POSIX and
UNIX standards require that "\fBps\ \-aux\fR" print all processes owned by a
user named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by
the
.B \-a
option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this
.B ps
may interpret the command as "\fBps\ aux\fR" instead and print a warning.
This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It
is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.
.P
By default,
.B ps
selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the
current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker.  It
displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process
(tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD\-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and
the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.
.P
The use of BSD\-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the
default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the
executable name.  You can override this with the
.B PS_FORMAT
environment variable.  The use of BSD\-style options will also change the
process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are
owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to
be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other
users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options
are described as being "identical" below, so
.B \-M
will be considered identical to \fBZ\fR and so on.
.P
Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The
default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to
the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it
meets any of the given selection criteria.

.SH "SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION"
.TP
.B a
Lift the BSD\-style "only yourself" restriction, which is imposed upon the
set of all processes when some BSD\-style (without "\-") options are used or
when the
.B ps
personality setting is BSD\-like.  The set of processes selected in this
manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An
alternate description is that this option causes
.B ps
to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when
used together with the
.B x
option.
.TP
.B \-A
Select all processes.  Identical to
.BR \-e .
.TP
.B \-a
Select all processes except both session leaders (see
.IR getsid (2))
and processes not associated with a terminal.
.TP
.B \-d
Select all processes except session leaders.
.TP
.B \-\-deselect
Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions
(negates the selection).  Identical to
.BR \-N .
.TP
.B \-e
Select all processes.  Identical to
.BR \-A .
.\" Current "g" behavior: add in the session leaders, which would
.\" be excluded in the sunos4 personality. Supposed "g" behavior:
.\" add in the group leaders -- at least according to the SunOS 4
.\" man page on the FreeBSD site. Uh oh. I think I had tested SunOS
.\" though, so maybe the code is correct.
.TP
.B g
Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may be
discontinued in a future release.  It is normally implied by the
.B a
flag, and is only useful when operating in the sunos4 personality.
.TP
.B \-N
Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions
(negates the selection).  Identical to
.BR \-\-deselect .
.TP
.B T
Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical to the
.B t
option without any argument.
.TP
.B r
Restrict the selection to only running processes.
.TP
.B x
Lift the BSD\-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon the
set of all processes when some BSD\-style (without "\-") options are used or
when the
.B ps
personality setting is BSD\-like.  The set of processes selected in this
manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means.  An
alternate description is that this option causes
.B ps
to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as
.BR ps ),
or to list all processes when used together with the
.B a
option.

.SH "PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST"
These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank\-separated or
comma\-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.  For example:

.TP
.RI \- 123
Identical to
.BI \-\-pid\  123 \fR.
.TP

Identical to
.BI \-\-pid\  123 \fR.
.TP
.BI \-C \ cmdlist
Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose executable name is
given in
.IR cmdlist .
NOTE: The command name is not the same as the command line. Previous versions
of procps and the kernel truncated this command name to 15 characters. This
limitation is no longer present in both. If you depended on matching only
15 characters, you may no longer get a match.
.TP
.BI \-G \ grplist
Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose
real group name or ID is in the
.I grplist
list.  The real group ID identifies the group of the user who created the
process, see
.IR getgid (2).
.TP
.BI \-g \ grplist
Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by session is
specified by many standards, but selection by effective group is the logical
behavior that several other operating systems use.  This
.B ps
will select by session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions
are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are also
specified.  See the
.B \-s
and
.B \-\-group
options.
.TP
.BI \-\-Group \ grplist
Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to
.BR \-G .
.TP
.BI \-\-group \ grplist
Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the processes
whose effective group name or ID is in
.IR grplist .
The effective group ID describes the group whose file access permissions are
used by the process (see
.IR getegid (2)).
The
.B \-g
option is often an alternative to
.BR \-\-group .
.TP
.BI p \ pidlist
Select by process ID.  Identical to

.BI \-\-ppid \ pidlist
Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a parent
process\ ID in
.IR pidlist .
That is, it selects processes that are children of those listed in
.IR pidlist .
.TP
.BI q \ pidlist
Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to
.B \-q
and
.BR \-\-quick\-pid .
.TP
.BI \-q \ pidlist
Select by PID (quick mode).
This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in
.IR pidlist .
With this option \fBps\fR reads the necessary info only
for the pids listed in the
.I pidlist
and doesn't apply additional filtering rules.
The order of pids is unsorted and preserved.
No additional selection options,
sorting and forest type listings are allowed in this mode.
Identical to

Select by tty.  Nearly identical to
.B \-t
and
.BR \-\-tty ,
but can also
be used with an empty

to indicate the terminal associated with
.BR ps .
Using the
.B T
option is considered cleaner than using
.B t
with an empty
.IR ttylist .
.TP
.BI \-t \ ttylist
Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the terminals
given in

Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can be specified in several
forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain "\-" may be used to select processes
not attached to any terminal.

User\-defined format.
.I format
is a single argument in the form of a blank\-separated or comma\-separated
list, which offers a way to specify individual output columns.  The
recognized keywords are described in the
.B STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
section below.  Headers may be renamed
.RB ( "ps \-o pid,\:ruser=RealUser \-o comm=Command" )
as desired.
If all column headers are empty
.RB ( "ps \-o pid= \-o comm=" )
then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase as
needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN
.RB ( "ps \-o pid,\:wchan=\:WIDE\-\:WCHAN\-\:COLUMN \-o comm" ).
Explicit width
control
.RB ( "ps opid,\:wchan:42,\:cmd" )
is offered too.  The behavior of

This

.B ps
does not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not give
this
.B ps
any special permissions.
.PP
CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running
during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and\ it does not
conform to the standards that
.B ps
otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.
.PP
The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including the
page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct task_struct.  This
is usually at least 20\ KiB of memory that is always resident.  SIZE is the
virtual size of the process (code+\:data+\:stack).
.PP
Processes marked <defunct> are dead processes (so\-called "zombies") that
remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.  These processes
will be destroyed by
.IR init (8)
if the parent process exits.
.PP
If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display
column, the username will be truncated.  See the \-o and \-O formatting
options to customize length.
.PP
Commands options such as
.B ps \-aux
are not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.
According to the POSIX and UNIX standards, the above command asks to
display all processes with a TTY (generally the commands users are
running) plus all processes owned by a user named "x".  If that user
doesn't exist, then

will assume you really meant

.SH "OBSOLETE SORT KEYS"
These keys are used by the BSD
.B O
option (when it is used for sorting).  The GNU
.B \-\-sort
option doesn't use these keys, but the specifiers described below in the
.B STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
section.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values
.B ps
uses and not the "cooked" values used in some of the output format fields
(e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device number, not according to the
terminal name displayed).  Pipe
.B ps
output into the
.BR sort (1)
command if you want to sort the cooked values.

.SH "AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS"
This
.B ps
supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the
formatting codes of
.IR printf (1)
and
.IR printf (3).
For example, the normal default output can be produced with this:
.B ps \-eo """%p %y %x %c""\fR."
The

.SH "STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS"
Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output
format (e.g., with option
.BR \-o )
or to sort the selected processes with the GNU\-style
.B \-\-sort
option.
.PP
For example:
.B ps \-eo pid,\:user,\:args \-\-sort user
.PP
This version of
.B ps
tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other implementations of
.BR ps .
.PP
The following user\-defined format specifiers may contain
spaces:
.BR args ", " cmd ", " comm ", " command ", " fname ", " ucmd ", " ucomm ,
.BR lstart ", " bsdstart ", " start .
.PP
Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

CODE	HEADER	DESCRIPTION

%cpu	%CPU	T{
cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.  Currently, it is the CPU
time used divided by the time the process has been running (cputime/realtime

file or another command, the output width is undefined (it may be 80,
unlimited, determined by the
.B TERM
variable, and so on).  The
