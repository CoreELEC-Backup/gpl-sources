	   Our acceleration function calculates a factor to accelerate input
	   deltas with. The function is a double incline with a plateau,
	   with a rough shape like this:

	  accel
	 factor
	   ^         ______
	   |        )
	   |  _____)
	   | /
	   |/
	   +-------------> speed in

	   Except the second incline is a curve, but well, asciiart.

	   The first incline is a linear function in the form
		   y = ax + b
		   where y is speed_out
		         x is speed_in
			 a is the incline of acceleration
			 b is minimum acceleration factor
	   for speeds up to the lower threshold, we decelerate, down to 30%
	   of input speed.
		   hence 1 = a * 7 + 0.3
		       0.7 = a * 7  => a := 0.1
		   deceleration function is thus:
			y = 0.1x + 0.3

	   The first plateau is the baseline.

	   The second incline is a curve up, based on magic numbers
	   obtained by trial-and-error.

	   Above the second incline we have another plateau because
	   by then you're moving so fast that extra acceleration doesn't
	   help.

	  Note:
	  * The minimum threshold is a result of trial-and-error and
	    has no other special meaning.
	  * 0.3 is chosen simply because it is above the Nyquist frequency
	    for subpixel motion within a pixel.

	   Don't assume anything about the specific numbers though, this was

	   the formula was optimized doing basic maths.
