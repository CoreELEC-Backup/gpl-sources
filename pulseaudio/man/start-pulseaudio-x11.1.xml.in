  <description>
    <p>This script starts pulseaudio (if not already running) and loads modules to
    publish access credentials to the PulseAudio server in the X11 root window and to synthesize
    X11 media key events on cork/uncork requests. Additionally it registers
    PulseAudio to the X11 Session Manager.</p>

    <p>All arguments are directly passed to pulseaudio.</p>
