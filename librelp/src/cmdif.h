/* This header defines the interface between the relp engine
 * and relp commands. A consistent interface is used to dispatch
 * commands to the respective command handlers. All handlers shall
 * use the macros provided in this file. This is especially important
 * as the interface may evolve in the future and the macros most
 * probably will hide the details.
 *
 * Please note that for each command there is a server- and a client
 * based handler. They, as well as all commands, are provided in separate
 * source files so that we can get to a nice granularity inside our
 * library (just in case if a resource-constrained caller needs to pull
 * just the bare essentials into its binary).
