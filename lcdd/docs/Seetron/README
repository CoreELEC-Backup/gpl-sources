This directory contains the custom character font files (CHARS*.BMP) and
a splash logo which can be displayed during powerup (vdr-logo-small.bmp).
Feel free to modify these with your favourite image editor (XV, The GIMP,
etc.) but make sure the fonts are withing the Seetron specification.

You can compile sgxbmp as follows

cc -o sgxbmp sgxbpm.c -lm

usage: ./sgxbmp port speed file mode
where...
  port is the port device name
  speed is the port speed
  file is the filename of bitmap image
  mode is 0 for normal and 1 for reverse

sgxbmp can be found at http://www.seetron.com/lcd_andex.htm

After uploading the bitmaps to the display you need to store
them permanently in the display as described on the manual page
http://www.seetron.com/sgxmnl.htm. The display uses EEPROM pages 0 and
1 as the default character set so you should just store CHARS1.BMP in
page 1. CHARS0.BMP is unmodified. This way, you can create whatever
custom characters you like, and just use them as "normal" characters.

Everything is semi-automatized by the supplied Makefile. Set the correct
port speed on the display (9600) and the serial port in the Makefile,
run "make", and you're done.

You may also want to write protect the EEPROM afterwards, and set some
settings valid on startup (backlight, splash screen, etc.). See the
ESC-W command in the Seetron docs. Basically, you can send all these
ESC commands to the display using

echo -en "\033..." > <port>

where \033 is the octal representation of the ESC character and <port> is
the serial device where the display is connected. So - setting backlight
on, display EEPROM page #2 as splash screen and write protect the EEPROM
would be

echo -en "\033W7" > <port>

Please mind you need to set the display to the SET position before
(switch on the back).

The character maps are derived from Seetron's original character maps
found on their web page (www.seetron.com). The additional characters
(German umlauts, heartbeat, ellipsis, horizontal and vertical bars)
were made with The GIMP. You can see the entire set using xv or something.
