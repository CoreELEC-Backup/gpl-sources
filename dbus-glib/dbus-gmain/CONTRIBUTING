The mainline git tree for this code is at:
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib -b dbus-gmain

= Contributing changes =

Be sure to match the existing code style (Emacs: "gnu").

If you are making major changes which you wish to be incorporated upstream,
please do as small commits to your local git tree, so there is a good
history of your changes.

When you consider changes ready for merging to mainline, use
"git-format-patch" or otherwise generate unified diffs.  Post those diffs
to a new bug at http://bugs.freedesktop.org, project DBus, component GLib.

For nontrivial changes please try to extend the test suite to cover it.

Run "make check" to run the test suite.

= Releases =

dbus-gmain is currently set up to be a git subtree or git submodule,
so it does not have releases in its own right. It gets merged or
otherwise included in larger projects like dbus-glib and dbus-python
instead.
