lvm fullreport produces formatted output about PVs, PV segments, VGs, LVs
and LV segments. The information is all gathered together for each VG
(under a per-VG lock) so it is consistent. Information gathered from
separate calls to \fBvgs\fP, \fBpvs\fP, and \fBlvs\fP can be inconsistent
if information changes between commands.
