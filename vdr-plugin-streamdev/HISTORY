  number of the device used on the server are returned respectively.

2012-05-29: Version 0.6.0

- Reimplemented some client device methods
- Proper fix for "client sends ABRT after TUNE". Obsoletes many hacks in client
- Added CLOCK_MONOTONIC timestamp and thread id to Dprintf
- Silenced warning (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- Updated Finnish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- Replaced server-side suspend modes with priority based precedence handling
- Client-side priority handling for VDR >= 1.7.25 and servers running VTP > 1.0
- Introduced VTP protocol version numbering for easier compatibility handling
  between different client and server versions. The server includes the protocol
  version in its greeting string, the client reports its version with the new
  command "VERS".
- Dropped compatibility of streamdev-server with VDR < 1.7.25

2012-05-12: Version 0.5.2

- Use fileno() to retrieve the fd from a FILE structure (submitted by an
  anonymous user)
- New special meaning "show current channel" when channel 0 is requested.
  Applies to HTTP streaming only (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- Fixed ProvidesChannel() on client always returning true since the new timeout
  option has been added.
- Updated Finnish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- With VDR 1.7.25 priorities down to -99 will be used. Please update
  "Minimum Priority" in streamdev-client setup.
- Use the new streamdev-client setup option "Live TV Priority" to control
  precedence among multiple clients. The VDR option "Primary Limit" which
  has previouly been used for this purpose has been dropped in VDR 1.7.25.
- Timout for network operations now configurable in streamdev-client setup
- Added timeout to Connect()
- Report the server-side HTTP status "503 Service unavailable" instead of
  the client-side error "409 Conflict" when a channel is unavailable
  (suggested by Methodus)
- Update of po headers and Finnish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- support for non-cycle-free setups (e.g. where two VDRs mutually share
  their DVB cards through streamdev-client/-server). Must be enabled in
  streamdev-server setup. Obsoletes recursion patches.
- API change of VDR 1.7.22
- VDR 1.7.22 obsoletes cap_net_raw patch. Added cap_net_raw patch for VDR

- Added "Hide mainmenu entry" option on server (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- Added server menu with list of clients. Connections can be terminated
  with the "red" key. The former main menu action of suspending live TV
  moved to the "blue" key.
- code cleanup and optimization (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- properly shutdown IGMP timeout handler thread when the plugin is stopped.
  Fixes occasional segfaults on VDR exit.
- fixed memory leak in libdvbmpeg read_pes (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- dropped several unused functions in libdvbmpeg
- restricted VTP command RENR to liemikuutio patch < 1.32. Build fails with
  newer versions of this patch (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- updated outdated COPYING file and FSF address (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- include SDT and TDT in TS streams
- the icy-name HTTP header sent with radio streams makes VLC pick the wrong
  demuxer. Send icy-name only for ES audio streams.
- fixed regression of "live TV must be switched in VDR main thread" change:
  deadlock in IGMP streaming server when switching live TV.
- streamdev-client returns true in its AvoidRecording() method introduced
  with VDR 1.7.19. Note however that the impact of NumProvidedSystems is
  higher.
- updated device selection to code of VDR 1.7.19
- adaption to VDR 1.7.12 cReceiver API change
- increased WRITERBUFSIZE. Has been reported to fix some ringbuffer
  overflows (thanks to Lubo¨ Dole¸el)
- check availability of channel if VTP command TUNE is called without
  prior PROV call (e.g. client side EPG scan)
- added support for VDR 1.7.19 SignalStrength/SignalQuality
- analog video channels use the same transponder and pid for different
  channels, so streamdev-client must always issue TUNE command
- server must close the VTP connection also if filter stream is broken
- fixed missing #ifdefs for new NumProvidedSystems setup option
- new externremux.sh mencoder config options: audio pid by language code
  (-alang) and verbosity (-msglevel) (thanks to Pekko Tiitto)

- return value of streamdev-clients cDevice::NumProvidedSystems() now
  configurable in plugin setup

2011-02-11: Version 0.5.1

- updated copy of GetClippedNumProvidedSystems to the version used since
  VDR 1.7.15 (reported by carel@vdrportal)
- fixed the code deciding if a device is in use for live TV or not. It did
  not work as expected for FF cards (reported by wtor@vdrportal)
- increased client side timeout for TUNE command
- more dsyslog messages to help troubleshouting channel switch issues
- improved the channel switch code trying to move live TV to different card
- make sure that a client doesn't interrupt replaying on server's FF card
  (reported by wtor@vdrportal)
- switching away live TV failed even when "always suspended" (reported by
  Michal Novotny)
- fixed regression: no receiver created for ES/PS/PES (reported by Gavin
  Hamill)
- VTP no longer uses a static priority value for its server-side receivers.
  The server stores channel and priority requested with the PROV command and
  re-uses these values in a subsequent TUNE for the same channel. The new
  PRIO command is used to update the receiver's priority if necessary.
- added parameter HEIGHT to externremux.sh
- fixed syslog messages reporting local instead of remote IP and port
- fixed regression of the GetDevice(...) change. Filter streaming to clients
  with a recent VDR version no longer worked.
- log an error if externremux.sh is missing or not executable
- since VDR 1.5.0 cDevice::GetDevice(...) is no longer a query only method.
  It detaches all receivers of the device it returns. So it is no longer
  suitable for testing the availability of a device. Added a copy of VDR's
  cDevice::GetDevice(...) without the detach receivers part as a workaround
  until a better solution is available
- added dsyslog messages to help troubleshouting channel switch issues
- VTP command SUSP didn't attach the player to the primary device
- fixed incompatibilities with older make versions
- replacing a connections receiver is now an atomic operation. Solves
  stuttering audio/video due to lost TS packets when adding/removing PIDs
- disabled attribute warn_unused_result in libdvbmpeg
- slightly increased thread priorities of cStreamdevWriter/Streamer
  (suggested by Rolf Ahrenberg)
- fixed missing support for invisible channel groups (groups without name)
  in HTTP menu (reported by Timothy D. Lenz)
- don't quote actual program call in externremux.sh, so you can run the
  program through e.g. nice or taskset just by extending the variable
  which holds the program name
- in externremux.sh each mencoder audio and video codec has a dedicated
  variable for a default option string now. Still you can override each
  default option with an URL parameter
- externremux.sh mencoder now uses scale parameter with negative height
  instead of -xy for scaling (suggested by vel_tins@vdrportal)
- added FPS (frames per second) parameter to externremux.sh (suggested by
  vel_tins@vdrportal)
- don't use std::map.at(). It's not available in older libstdc++ version
  (reported by Matthias Prill)
- fixed extremux x264 using value of ABR for VBR (thanks to vel_tins@vdrportal)

2010-07-20: Version 0.5.0b

- fixed wrong URL path in m3u playlists (reported by Norman Thiel)

2010-07-20: Version 0.5.0a

- set externremux.sh executable in distribution archive
- externremux quality value should be wlan54, not wlan45 (reported by
  wolfi.m@vdrportal)

2010-07-19: Version 0.5.0

- using SIGINT in externremux to kill mencoder works better than SIGTERM;
  especially x264 still needs a SIGKILL sometimes

  Rolf Ahrenberg)
- HTTP headers now have to be emitted by externremux script
- pass channel related information and URL parameters to externremux script
  through environment
- implement CGI like interface for externremux script
- dropped "Synchronize EPG" feature. Please use epgsync-plugin instead
  (available from http://vdr.schmirler.de)
