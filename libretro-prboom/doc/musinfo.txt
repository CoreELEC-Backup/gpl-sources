MUSINFO support in PrBoom libretro
=====================================================

MUSINFO is a control lump originating from Risen3D and also supported by many
other ports. It is used to associate music lumps to numbers, which are then
referenced by "music changer" things with an editor number in the 14101—14164
range.

The syntax is as follows:

<MAPNAME>
<number> <MUSICLUMP>
<number> <MUSICLUMP>
...
<MAPNAME>
<number> <MUSICLUMP>
<number> <MUSICLUMP>
...
etc.


For example:

MAP01
1 D_ROMERO
2 D_STALKS
MAP02
1 D_RUNNIN
7 D_MESSAG


Valid numbers for music lumps are in the 1—64 range. The value 0 was not
originally supported by the Risen3D spec but it has come to be used by several
source ports to switch to the default music of the map. This behavior has also
been added to this source port.


Within a map, each song is associated to MusicChangers mapthings with an editor
number equal to 14100 + number. So in the above example, a thing 14107 in MAP02
would trigger a music change to D_MESSAG, and a thing 14100 would trigger a
return to the default music for the level.

Music changer things are triggered when a player enters the sector in which they
are placed. A 30-tics delay before the music changes is used to prevent the
soundtrack from resetting constantly if the player moves quickly back and forth
between two sectors with different music changers.

ZDoom/Eternity based source ports use also the doomednum 14165 for Hexen-style
format version of the MusicChanger actor which uses one of its Hexen-style args
to define the actual number.
