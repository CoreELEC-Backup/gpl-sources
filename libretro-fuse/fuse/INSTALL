Building Fuse
-------------

To compile Fuse (see below for instructions for other ports):

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-fb		Use the framebuffer interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-sdl		Use the SDL interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary as libspectrum provides
replacements for all the routines used by Fuse.

Another useful option is `--with-local-prefix=DIRECTORY' which allows
you to specify that you have some of the libraries needed by Fuse in
`<DIRECTORY>/lib' and the necessary header files in
`<DIRECTORY>/include'. If you specify the `--prefix' option to tell
Fuse to install itself somewhere other than in /usr/local, that
directory will automatically be searched as well.

Then just:

$ make

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to 'configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Once you've got Fuse configured and built, read the man page :-)

Note that if you're using version of Fuse from Subversion rather than
one of the released tarballs, you'll need to run `autogen.sh' before
running 'configure' for the first time.

Building the OS X version of Fuse
---------------------------------

The native Cocoa port by Fredrick Meunier <fredm@spamcop.net> comes as
a set of Xcode projects for libgcrypt, libspectrum and Fuse itself.

Building the Wii version of Fuse
--------------------------------

You'll need to have the standard Wii homebrew toolchain installed; see
eg <http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DevkitPro> for some information on setting
this up.

After that, make sure the dev tools are in your path (export
PATH=$PATH:$DEVKITPPC/bin) and that a Wii version of libspectrum has been
built and installed.

Then, use this configure line:

./configure --target=powerpc-gekko --host=powerpc-gekko \
	    --with-wii \
	    --without-libxml2 --without-libiconv --without-gpm \
	    --without-x --without-glib \
	    CFLAGS="-g -I$DEVKITPPC/include -I$DEVKITPRO/libogc/include -DGEKKO" \
	    LDFLAGS="-g -mrvl -mcpu=750 -meabi -mhard-float \
                     -Wl,-Map,fuse.elf.map -L$DEVKITPPC/lib \
                     -L$DEVKITPRO/libogc/lib/wii" \
            LIBS="-lfat -lwiiuse -lbte -logc -lm"

Finally, to build, use this line:

EXEEXT=".elf" make -e

This should build fuse.elf, which you can run on your Wii via the usual
methods.

Building the Win32 version of Fuse
----------------------------------

You'll need to have the MinGW <http://www.mingw.org> or MinGW-w64 toolchain
<http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net>, e.g., on Debian:
`apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime'

On Windows, besides the former toolchain, you'll need an environment that
includes a collection of Unix tools, like MSYS <http://www.mingw.org> or
Cygwin <http://cygwin.com>.

The next examples build libspectrum and Fuse without any external library for
the sake of clarity, but all these libraries successfully compile with MingGW
environment - in case of problems with compiling any of the libs please refer to
the lib's homepage for help.

1) On Linux, first have to compile libspectrum:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --without-libaudiofile --without-zlib \
	    --without-libgcrypt --without-bzip2 --without-glib --prefix=`pwd`
make install

This should `install' into the source directory.

Then, compile Fuse:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --without-glib --prefix=`pwd` \
	    --with-libspectrum-prefix=`pwd`/../libspectrum --with-win32 \
	    --without-libxml2 --without-zlib --without-png --without-x
make

You have to use the real path of libspectrum with `--with-libspectrum-prefix='.
This should build `fuse.exe' without any external lib, but you can run it on
Windows or Linux (with Wine).

With wine you need `fltmgr.sys' in Windows `system32' directory. (e.g.:
~/.wine/c_drive/windows/system32).

2) On Windows, using MSYS + MinGW toolchain, first build libspectrum:

./configure --without-glib --without-libaudiofile --without-libgcrypt \
	    --without-zlib --without-bzip2 --prefix=/usr/local
make install

Then, build Fuse:
	    
./configure --with-win32 --without-glib --without-libxml2 --without-zlib \
	    --without-png --prefix=/usr/local
make

3) On Windows, using Cygwin + MinGW toolchain, first build libspectrum:

./configure --build=i686-pc-cygwin --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --without-glib \
	    --without-libaudiofile --without-libgcrypt --without-zlib \
	    --without-bzip2 --prefix=/usr/local/i686-pc
make install

Then, build Fuse:

./configure --build=i686-pc-cygwin --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --with-win32 \
        --without-glib --without-libxml2 --without-zlib --without-png \
        --prefix=/usr/local/i686-pc
make

Note: you need `libspectrum-8.dll' and the `roms' directory and the `lib'
  directory to `fuse' run perfectly. You may copy this file and directories
  into that directory where `fuse.exe' exists. On Windows you may need to
  copy all files from `lib/uncompressed' into `lib'. Alternatively, you could
  run this rule:

  make install-win32 DESTDIR=/path/to/Fuse

  If you are planning to distribute Windows binaries with third parties on a
  regular basis, maybe you will find the next rules quite useful:

  make dist-win32-zip
  make dist-win32-7z
  make dist-win32-exe

  Additional tools are required for the former rules: Info-Zip, p7zip and NSIS,
  respectively. That will make a temporary subdirectory (fuse-VERSION-win32)
  in the build directory and then will create a package.
