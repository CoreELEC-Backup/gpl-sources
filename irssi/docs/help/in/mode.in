    The target nickname or channel and the modes with their parameters to set or
    remove.

    If the target nickname or channel is omitted, the active nickname or channel
    will be used.

%9Description:%9

    Modifies the user or channel modes for which you are privileged to modify.

    You can specify multiple modes in one command and prepend them by using the
    '+' sign to set or '-' sign to unset; modes that require a parameter will be
    retrieved from the argument list.

    Some common channel modes are:

        b <mask>:        Adds or removes a ban; a ban will prevent a user who
                         matches the given mask from joining the channel unless
                         he or she is invited or in the exempt list.
        e <mask>:        Adds or removes a ban exception; users who match a mask
                         on the exempt list are able to join a channel even if
                         they also match an entry on the ban list.
        i:               When enabled, users need to be invited into the channel
                         or have a matching entry in the invite list.
        I <mask>:        Adds or removes an invite; users who match a mask on
                         the invite list are able to join even if the channel is
                         set to invite only.
        k <key>:         Adds or removes a channel key, aka a password; users
                         will not be able to join the channel without providing
                         the key.
        l <count>:       Adds, removes or updates the maximum amount of users
                         that may join the channel.
        m:               When enabled, users who are not opped or voiced cannot
                         send messages to the channel.
        n:               When enabled, users who are not on the channel cannot
                         send messages to it.
        p:               When enabled, the channel will not be displayed in your
                         WHOIS output.
        s:               When enabled, the channel will not be displayed in the
                         LIST output.
        t:               When enabled, users who are not opped or voices cannot
                         modify the channel topic.
        o <nickname>:    Adds or removes the operator status from a nickname.
        v <nickname>:    Adds or removes the voice status from a nickname.

    Some common user modes are:

        i:               When enabled, other users will not be able to see you
                         on a WHO output unless they are in the channel
                         themselves.
        w:               When enabled, you will receive WALLOP messages from IRC
                         operators.
        s:               When enabled, you will receive special notices or debug
                         messages from the server.

    Many networks have additional user and channel modes; we highly recommend
    you to read the documentation of the networks you frequently connect to and
    maximize your IRC experience.
