-- MuMuDVB 2.0 --
New features / improvements :
 * Autoconfiguration: complete rewrite, more flexible, can follow channel changes, partial autoconf dropped.
 * EPG: Electronic Programs guide (EIT table) available from the webservices
 * Video: support for HEVC
 * Scam: various improvements and fixes
 * Tuning: Diseqc improvments

-- MuMuDVB 1.7 --
New features / improvements :
 * Implements dual stack for IPv6 Mulicast
 * Tuning: Support for multiple tuners and DVB-T2 DVB-S2
 * Error : Add option filter_transport_error to send packets with error bit set by decoder
 * Dump : Possibility to dump the raw stream for debugging purposes + update of the man page
 * Logging: Possibility to choose the destination of the logs : console, file or syslog. The formatting of the logs can be adjusted.
 * CAM Menu : CAM menu access while streaming (using a web/AJAX interface - see WEBSERVICES.txt
 * Templates support for more flexibility in autoconfiguration
 * Webservices : XML webservice exposing detailed streaming status (see WEBSERVICES.txt)
 * PID : Add option filename_pid Possibility to define the path for the pid file :
 * DiSEqC : improvments : support of uncommited switches. Set of the tone burst
 * Autoconfiguration: Several improvements in the options and in the parsing of the DVB tables
 * Possibility to tune the up/down detection thresholds
 * Testing suite : test program for various MuMuDVB functions to compile this program, run "make check"
 * Table parsing : the NIT is parsed for debugging purposes, possibility to use the LCN in autoconfiguration, better detection of PIDs
 * Signal display : more information (uncorrected blocks)
 * Cards listing with their capabilities.

Bugs corrected :
 * SDT rewrite improve : we copy only the interesting services to the rewritten SDT
 * Filter : New option psi_tables_filtering to keep only mandatory PSI PID. Useful for some STB.
 * Memory leaks

Next :
 * autoconfiguration : merge of the two autoconfiguration modes
 * IPv6 : HTTP unicast IPv6
 * RTSP

-- MuMuDVB 1.6 --

New features / improvements :
 * Support for HTTP Unicast
 * Implementation of the RTP headers.
 * The limit in the size of the PAT PID for PAT rewriting has been removed
 * PAT rewrite is less CPU consuming
 * ATSC autoconfiguration fully fonctionnal
 * Autoconfiguration: MuMuDVB can update the PIDs while running if they change
 * Tuning: Support for circular polarization, more LNBs and possibility to fix LNB voltage to 0V
 * Tuning: We can set the coderate (FEC) for satellite and cable with the option coderate
 * Documentation rewrite. The doc is now in asciidoc format + new configuration examples
 * Autoconfiguration: We wait for all the channels in the PAT to be configured before continuing
 * Autoconfiguration: New option autoconf_scrambled which permit to autoconfigure scrambbled channels even without cam_support
 * CAM support: We look on the packets to check if the descrambling was successful
 * Option dont_send_scrambled to avoid sending scrambled packets (thus not making SAP announces for scrambled channels)
 * Option to show the traffic for each channel
 * Reduce CPU usage : experimental feature : DVB buffering
 * CAM : MuMuDVB can reset the CAM module if it initialize badly
 * SAP : new option sap_uri.
 * VLC bug : add an option to avoid sending the SDT, this is a workaround for VLC

Bugs corrected :
 * Cam support : wait a bit more between polling events (solve problems with T-Rex Supermodule v4.6)
 * Cam : Change the list managment. This solves the problem of only one channel descrambled with aston pro
 * We check if the PMT_QUERY sending (asking a channel to be descrambled) to the CAM was sucessful. 
 * Autoconfiguration, pat rewrite, CAM : we check the transport_stream id. This solve problems with shared PMT betwwen channels.

-- Mumudvb 1.5.4 --

New features / improvements : 
 * New stack for cam support, based on libdvben50221 from dvb_apps
 * Option dont_tune to avoid mumudvb to try to tune the card (can be used to test dvb-s2)
 * Non ascii channels names are now well handled by autoconf
 * Autoconfiguration : Better pid selection (new descriptor types added), can correct issues with some nondetected audio/video pids
 * Autoconfiguration ; Detection of the PCR PID, this solves problem with vlc and the absence of sound on certain channels
 * A configuration file is generated after autoconfiguration
 * Preliminary support for ATSC cards, new option atsc_modulation
	
Bugs corrected :
 * We don't set the filters multiple times
 * Better reading of the config file
 * Segmentation faults with some particular configuration files
 * Bug in intialisation scripts
 * Better handling of partial packets. Mumudvb doesn't exit anymore.
	
-- Mumudvb 1.5.3 --

New features :
