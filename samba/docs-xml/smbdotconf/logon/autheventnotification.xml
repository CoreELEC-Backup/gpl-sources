	<para>When enabled, this option causes Samba (acting as an
	Active Directory Domain Controller) to stream authentication
	events across the internal message bus.  Scripts built using
	Samba's python bindings can listen to these events by
	registering as the service
	<filename moreinfo="none">auth_event</filename>.</para>

	<para>This should be considered a developer option (it assists
	in the Samba testsuite) rather than a facility for external
	auditing, as message delivery is not guaranteed (a feature
	that the testsuite works around).  Additionally Samba must be
	compiled with the jansson support for this option to be
	effective.</para>

	<para>The authentication events are also logged via the normal
	logging methods when the <smbconfoption name="log level"/> is
	set appropriately.</para>
