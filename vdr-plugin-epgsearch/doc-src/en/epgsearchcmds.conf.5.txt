=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchcmds.conf> - EPG Commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains commands, like the file commands.conf or reccmds.conf, which
can be applied to the selected event in one of the EPG menues. (It does not support
the nested commands as introduced in vdr-1.7.12)

Internal epgsearch has 8 not changeable commands.

If there is a F<epgsearchcmds.conf>, the commands in it will be appended to
the list of the internal commands, starting with 9.

=head2 Language

You can use different files for each language. For example F<epgsearchcmds-eng.conf>
will be loaded if the, in VDR selected, language is english.

If there is no file for the selected language, epgsearch tries to load
F<epgsearchcmds.conf>.
