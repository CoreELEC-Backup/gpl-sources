"""tstools -- a package of Pyrex bindings for the tstools

This is being developed on a Mac, running OS X, and also tested on my Ubuntu
system at work.

I do not expect it to build (as it stands) on Windows, as it is making
assumptions that may not follow thereon.

It is my intent to worry about Windows after it works on the platforms that
I can test most easily!
