	<para>
	When enabled (the default is disabled) unused dynamic dns records are
	periodically removed.
	</para>
	<warning><para>
	This option should not be enabled for installations created with
	versions of samba before 4.9. Doing this will result in the loss of
	static DNS entries. This is due to a bug in previous versions
	of samba (BUG 12451) which marked dynamic DNS records as static and
	static records as dynamic.
	</para></warning>
	<note><para>
	If one record for a DNS name is static (non-aging) then no other record
	for that DNS name will be scavenged.
