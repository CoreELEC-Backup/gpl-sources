%9Description:%9

    After establishing a DCC CHAT connection that you initiated, you might
    encounter some protocol issues if the target is using mIRC.

    If you or your target sees some unexpected output or behavior inside a DCC
    CHAT session, use this command to enable mIRC compatibility mode.

    When receiving a connection from an mIRC user, the compatibility mode will
    automatically be enabled.
