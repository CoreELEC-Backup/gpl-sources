=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchdirs.conf> - List of directories for selecting in epgsearch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is one source of the 'Select directory' menu.

This file contain directories which can be used for search timers or
ordinary timers.

The items displayed are read from the following sources:

   * current recording directories
   * current timer directories
   * directories used in search timers
   * directories specified in F<epgsearchdirs.conf>

The menu merges theses directories and displays only distinct
directories. With key 'yellow' one can change the depth of the
directories shown. If there are items, that contain category variables
like '%genre%', these entries are always shown before any other
directories. They are also not level dependent, but are always shown
with their full directory.

If this menu is called from the timer edit menu and an item is
selected that contains the variables "%title%" or "%subtitle" then the
'file' item of the timer gets cleared, since title or subtitle already
exist in the 'directory' item.
