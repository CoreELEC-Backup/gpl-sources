=================

NAME
----
btrfs-property - get/set/list properties for given btrfs object.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs property* <subcommand> <args>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*btrfs property* is used to get/set/list property for given btrfs object.
See the description of *get* subcommand for more information about
both btrfs object and property.

*btrfs property* provides an unified and user-friendly method to tune different
btrfs properties instead of using the traditional method like `chattr`(1) or
`lsattr`(1).

SUBCOMMAND
----------
*get* [-t <type>] <object> [<name>]::
Gets a property from a btrfs object.
+
A btrfs object, which is set by <object>, can be a btrfs filesystem
itself, a btrfs subvolume, an inode(file or directory) inside btrfs,
or a device on which a btrfs exists.
+
The '-t <type>' option can be used to explicitly
specify what type of object you meant. This is only needed when a
property could be set for more then one object type.
+
Possible types are 's[ubvol]', 'f[ilesystem]', 'i[node]' and 'd[evice]'.
+
Set the name of property by '<name>'. If no '<name>' is specified,
all properties for the given object are printed. '<name>' is one of
the followings.

ro::::
read-only flag of subvolume: true or false
label::::
label of device
compression::::
compression setting for an inode: lzo, zlib, or "" (empty string)

*list* [-t <type>] <object>::
Lists available properties with their descriptions for the given object.
+
See the description of *get* subcommand for the meaning of each option.

*set* [-t <type>] <object> <name> <value>::
Sets a property on a btrfs object.
+
See the description of *get* subcommand for the meaning of each option.

EXIT STATUS

returned in case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------
*btrfs* is part of btrfs-progs.
