.SH "NAME"
samba-regedit \- ncurses based tool to manage the Samba registry
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
samba\-regedit [\-\-help] [\-\-usage] [\-d\ <debug\ level>] [\-s\ <configuration\ file>] [\-l\ <log\ directory>] [\-V] [\-\-option=<parameter>=<value>] [\-\-socket\-options=<SOCKETOPTIONS>] [\-\-netbiosname=<NETBIOSNAME>] [\-\-workgroup=<WORKGROUP>] [\-\-scope=<SCOPE>] [\-\-user=<USERNAME>] [\-N] [\-k] [\-\-authentication\-file=<FILE>] [\-\-signing=[on|off|required]] [\-P] [\-e] [\-C] [\-\-pw\-nt\-hash]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
samba\-regedit
is a ncurses based tool to manage the Samba registry\&. It can be used to show/edit registry keys/subkeys and their values\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-?|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1\&.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBlog level\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-usage
.RS 4
Display brief usage message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V|\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the program version number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s|\-\-configfile=<configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l|\-\-log\-basename=logdirectory
.RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files\&. The extension
\fB"\&.progname"\fR
will be appended (e\&.g\&. log\&.smbclient, log\&.smbd, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-option=<name>=<value>
.RS 4
Set the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line\&. This overrides compiled\-in defaults and options read from the configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n|\-\-netbiosname <primary NetBIOS name>
.RS 4
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself\&. This is identical to setting the
\m[blue]\fBnetbios name\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
smb\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i|\-\-scope <scope>
.RS 4
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
nmblookup
will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names\&. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001\&.txt and rfc1002\&.txt\&. NetBIOS scopes are
\fIvery\fR
rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with\&.
.RE
.PP
\-W|\-\-workgroup=domain
.RS 4
Set the SMB domain of the username\&. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb\&.conf\&. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-O|\-\-socket\-options socket options
.RS 4
TCP socket options to set on the client socket\&. See the socket options parameter in the
smb\&.conf
manual page for the list of valid options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-N|\-\-no\-pass
.RS 4
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user\&. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password\&.
.sp
Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password\&.
.sp
If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently ignored and no password will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k|\-\-kerberos
.RS 4
Try to authenticate with kerberos\&. Only useful in an Active Directory environment\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C|\-\-use\-ccache
.RS 4
Try to use the credentials cached by winbind\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A|\-\-authentication\-file=filename
.RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection\&. The format of the file is
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
username = <value>
password = <value>
domain   = <value>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users\&.
.RE
.PP
\-U|\-\-user=username[%password]
.RS 4
Sets the SMB username or username and password\&.
.sp
If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted\&. The client will first check the
\fBUSER\fR
environment variable, then the
\fBLOGNAME\fR
variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased\&. If these environmental variables are not found, the username
\fBGUEST\fR
is used\&.
.sp
A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password\&. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment variables\&. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users\&. See the
\fI\-A\fR
for more details\&.
.sp
Be cautious about including passwords in scripts\&. Also, on many systems the command line of a running process may be seen via the
ps
command\&. To be safe always allow
rpcclient
to prompt for a password and type it in directly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S|\-\-signing on|off|required
.RS 4
Set the client signing state\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P|\-\-machine\-pass
.RS 4
Use stored machine account password\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e|\-\-encrypt
.RS 4
This command line parameter requires the remote server support the UNIX extensions or that the SMB3 protocol has been selected\&. Requests that the connection be encrypted\&. Negotiates SMB encryption using either SMB3 or POSIX extensions via GSSAPI\&. Uses the given credentials for the encryption negotiation (either kerberos or NTLMv1/v2 if given domain/username/password triple\&. Fails the connection if encryption cannot be negotiated\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pw\-nt\-hash
.RS 4
The supplied password is the NT hash\&.

The samba\-regedit man page was written by Karolin Seeger\&.
