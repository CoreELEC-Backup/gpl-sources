vgcreate creates a new VG on block devices. If the devices were not
previously intialized as PVs with \fBpvcreate\fP(8), vgcreate will
inititialize them, making them PVs. The pvcreate options for initializing
devices are also available with vgcreate.

When vgcreate uses an existing PV, that PV's existing values for metadata
size, PE start, etc, are used, even if different values are specified in
the vgcreate command.  To change these values, first use pvremove on the
device.
