How to use check suite
----------------------

You need DejaGNU package.  Assuming you have it all you need to do is

make check


Something failed now what
-------------------------

First determine what did not work.  If only one check failed you can
run it individually in debugging mode.  For example

runtest -a -de -v w.test/w.exp
Expect binary is /usr/bin/expect
Using /usr/share/dejagnu/runtest.exp as main test driver
[...]

Do not bother capturing screen output, it is in testrun.log which
test suite generated.

$ ls  testrun.* dbg.log
dbg.log  testrun.log  testrun.sum

The reason why test failed should be in dbg.log.  Assuming you
figured out the reason you could write a patch fixing w.test/w.exp
and send it to upstream.

If you do not know how, or have time, to fix the issue create tar.gz
file containing test run logs and submit it to upstream maintainers.
Notice that in later case upstream sometimes has to ask clarifying
questions about environment where problem occurred.
