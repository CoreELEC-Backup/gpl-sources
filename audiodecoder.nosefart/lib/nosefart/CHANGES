2.9-mls - 2013-05-10

GCC now requires that -lm comes after the object name.  Trivial change
to Makefile to allow compilation.  Thanks to Gall for reporting this.

2.8-mls

GNU Make 3.82 broke the Makefile so that it no longer made the necessary
build directories. Put in a simple hack to make it keep working.

2.7-mls

Added 16-bit fixes and -B switch to Linux nosefart by Chris King.

Improved gnosefart error message given when nosefart isn't found.

2.6-mls

Updated gnosefart to 1.4.

2.5-mls 

Added some lines to src/machine/nsf.c so that it's possible for programs
that use it to play multiple songs at once.  (This doesn't affect the
behavior of the Linux programs in this package at all. They still just
play one thing at a time.)

gnosefart updated to 1.3

2.4-mls (13 Sept 2005)

Updated nosefart code for gcc-4.0.

gnosefart updated to 1.2.

2.3-mls (12 Aug 2004)

Updated winamp plugin, thanks to K`rai.

2.2-mls (1 May 2004)

Added README.cl-amp (taken from Eli's page).

Added a fflush to nosefart for the benifit of gnosefart.

2.1-mls (23 April 2004)

gnosefart updated to 1.0.

2.0-mls (16 April 2004)

Added gnosefart 0.9, a GTK frontend for nosefart.

Decided to be more confident about my version numbering.

Nosefart now returns 0 if nothing went wrong.

1.92k-mls (4 April 2004)

Fixed a bug in the UI that made it not refresh properly.  Improved spec file.

1.92j-mls (21 March 2004)

A few small tweaks to nsfinfo and the interface.  Added spec file
for building RPMs.

1.92i-mls

Fixed hiccup that sometimes occurs when time calculation finishes.  The fix
is to simply not have the parent process wait() for the child, which means
that the child hangs around as a zombie as long as nosefart is running. Oh
well.

Fixed a bug that caused multiple free()s of the same thing to hang the time
calculation on certain files (lifeforce.nsf).

1.92h-mls

Time calculation (for Linux command line) now is done by a child process
which communicates the answer back through shared memory.  (If this doesn't
work, it falls back on the old behavior.) This prevents a long wait before
the music starts.

Added options to disable channels from the start (-1, -2, etc).

Added output of progress (i.e.  "4/94 seconds, 207/5589 frames").

1.92g-mls

Abstracted away the time calculation stuff so that it should be easy to make
it go with versions other than Linux/FreeBSD command line.

1.92f-mls

Added automatic track length calculation to the linux command line
version (-a option). (Developers: Note that a lot of ugly hacking was
involved here.)

Added xmms plugin.

Thanks to benjamin gerard <ben@sashipa.com> for both of these.

1.92e-mls

Added options -i (print file information and exit) and -l (play for x seconds
and then exit).

Fixed unaligned 16-bit memory access in the 6502 emulator.  This allows
nosefart to run on platforms other than x86 and PPC.

1.92d-mls

Added a Makefile to make it possible to compile a library suitable for dcplaya 
input plugin. 

1.92c-mls

Merged in the CL-amp plugin for BeOS.  I don't know if it actually works 
yet, since I don't have BeOS, but hopefully someone will test it and get 
back to me.

Made it compile in FreeBSD.  I don't know if it actually works, tho,
since I only have a shell account.  Someone tell me, please...

1.92b-mls

First sourceforge release.  I've improved the Linux frontend.  Now you can 
see what channels are enabled, these channels persist over track changes 
and if you advance past the last track, it loops back to the first.
