lvscan scans all VGs or all supported LVM block devices in the system for
LVs. The output consists of one line for each LV indicating whether or not
it is active, a snapshot or origin, the size of the device and its
allocation policy. Use \fBlvs\fP(8) or \fBlvdisplay\fP(8) to obtain more
comprehensive information about LVs.
