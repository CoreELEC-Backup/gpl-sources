 <CENTER><H1>Default driver.</H1></CENTER>

 <P>
  The default driver reads/writes data to the <code>/dev/lirc[0-9]</code>
  devices. It's a LIRC_LIRCMODE2 type driver handling timing information.</p>
<p>
  The <code>/dev/lirc[0-9]</code> devices are created by certain kernel
  modules (most of which former LIRC drivers which have been moved into
  the kernel). They reflect a IR remote driver loaded by the kernel.</p>
<p>
  The kernel drivers will by default recieve and decode the timing data
  from the remote and send them as events on a /dev/input device. However,
  the will also make the raw timing data available on a /dev/lirc device.
  The default driver listens to this data, and decodes it to events
  presented to the applications on a (default)<code> /var/run/lirc/lircd
  </code> socket.
<p>
  Without further configuration, this means that a single button press can
  reach the application both on the /dev/input and the /var/run/lirc/lircd
  interfaces. The symptoms of this is that each press is doubled. </p>
<p>
  To fix this, force the kernel driver to use the lirc protocol, which
  effectively mutes the /dev/input device. On a simple system with only
  one remote this is done using
<pre>
       sudo echo 'lirc' &gt; /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols
</pre>
  From 0.9.3+ this is done automatically by the driver.
<p>
  The driver also supports sending (IR blasting).
<p>
  Contrary to most drivers, the default driver probes the loaded kernel
  modules about their capabilities. This means that the static capability
  information displayed by lirc-lsplugins(1) doesn't make much sense.
