----------------------------------------
Virtual Jaguar v2.1.0 Qt release INSTALL
----------------------------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The minimum requirements for compiling Virtual Jaguar from source are:

 o  GCC v4.4.x or higher
 o  SDL v1.2.14 or higher
 o  zlib v1.2.5
 o  libcdio v0.90 or higher (optional, for Jaguar CD support)
 o  OpenGL libraries
 o  Qt 4.7.3 or higher
 o  supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw, MacOS); other
    OSs may work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile.


COMPILING:
----------

Assuming that you meet the minimum software requirements, you can compile
Virtual Jaguar by issuing the following command in the directory where you
decompressed the source:

make

Optionally you can manually strip virtualjaguar[.exe] to downsize the binary.
You can also run upx on the binary as well and you'll end up with a somewhat
smaller binary.

That's it! You can now start the emulator with ./virtualjaguar. See the built
in help (Help|Contents) for more info.
