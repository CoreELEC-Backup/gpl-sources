NAME
----
btrfs - a toolbox to manage btrfs filesystems

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs* <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *btrfs* utility is a toolbox for managing btrfs filesystems.  There are
command groups to work with subvolumes, devices, for whole filesystem or other
specific actions. See section *COMMANDS*.

There are also standalone tools for some tasks like *btrfs-convert* or
*btrfstune* that were separate historically and/or haven't been merged to the
main utility. See section 'STANDALONE TOOLS' for more details.

For other topics (mount options, etc) please refer to the separate manual
page `btrfs`(5).

COMMAND SYNTAX
--------------

Any command name can be shortened as far as it stays unambiguous,
however it is recommended to use full command names in scripts.
All command groups have their manual page named *btrfs-<group>*.

For example: it is possible to run *btrfs sub snaps* instead of
*btrfs subvolume snapshot*.
But *btrfs file s* is not allowed, because *file s* may be interpreted
both as *filesystem show* and as *filesystem sync*.

If the command name is ambiguous, the list of conflicting options is
printed.

For an overview of a given command use 'btrfs command --help'
or 'btrfs [command...] --help --full' to print all available options.

STANDALONE TOOLS
----------------

There are several standalone tools to provide certain functionality. If the
functionality proves to be useful, the standalone tools are declared obsolete
and their functionality copied to the main tool. The deprecation period is long
(years) and the obsolete binaries are still provided.

Tools that are still in active use without an equivalent in *btrfs*:

*btrfs-convert*:: in-place conversion from ext2/3/4 filesystems to btrfs
*btrfstune*:: tweak some filesystem properties on a unmounted filesystem
*btrfs-select-super*:: rescue tool to overwrite primary superblock from a spare copy
*btrfs-find-root*:: rescue helper to find tree roots in a filesystem

Deprecated and obsolete tools:

*btrfs-debug-tree*:: moved to *btrfs inspect-internal dump-tree*
*btrfs-show-super*:: moved to *btrfs inspect-internal dump-super*
*btrfs-zero-log*:: moved to *btrfs rescue zero-log*

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*btrfs* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in
case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------
*btrfs* is part of btrfs-progs.
Please refer to the btrfs wiki http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for
further details.
