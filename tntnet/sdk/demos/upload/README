Demo-application "upload" 
=========================

This application demostrates how to handle an upload-button

To run the application enter "tntnet" in this directory. If you 
have not yet installed but only built tntnet, you need to enter the path to 
the generated tntnet-program: 
  "../../../framework/runtime/tntnet"

You can see the result in your browser at http://localhost:8000/upload
