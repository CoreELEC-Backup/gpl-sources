.SH NAME
fstrcasecmpi \- fuzzy comparison of two strings ignoring case
.if require_index \{
.XX "fstrcasecmpi(3)" "fuzzy comparison of two strings ignoring case"
.\}
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <fstrcmp.h>
.sp 0.3
#define FSTRCMP_IDENTICAL
.br
#define FSTRCMP_THRESHOLD
.br
#define FSTRCMP_ERROR
.sp 0.3
int fstrcasecmpi(const char *string1, const char *string2);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]fstrcmp\fP() function compares the two strings,
\f[I]string1\fP and \f[I]string2\fP,
ignoring case.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \f[B]fstrcasecmpi\fP function returns an \f[B]int\fP value between
0 and FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL.  A value of 0 means the strings are
utterly un-alike.  A value of FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL means the strings are
identical.  A value of more than FSTRCMPI_THRESHOLD (it lies between 0
and FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL) would be considered "similar" by most people.
.PP
A value of FSTRCMPI_ERROR (always negative) indicates a \f[I]malloc\fP(3)
failure.
