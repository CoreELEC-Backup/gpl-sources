/**
 This demo shows how to create a standalone application server just with
 libtntnet.

 Normally applications are compiled into shared libraries and loaded at
 runtime. Configuration, especially the mapping from url to component, is done
 with tntnet.xml.

 As an alternative you may write your own small main function and compile the
 components into a program. There is no configuration file tntnet.xml read any
 more but you have to code your mappings into the program. The advantage is,
 that there is no configuration file needed. Since the mappings are often a
 fundamental part of your application, it is better to hard code it into the
 application.
