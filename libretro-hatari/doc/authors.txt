 Contributors:
 -------------

Following people contributed code or patches to this projects and/or
helped to find bugs in Hatari (listed in random order - and if someone
is missing here, please remind me!):

- Jean-Baptiste Berlioz <tobe at freemind-tobe.com> : Cycle accurate
  Blitter emulation.

- David Savinkoff : More accurate printer emulation, LMC1992 emulation
  patches, IIR/Low Pass filters and many improvements to the YM2149 model
  to get a close emulation of the circuit used to merge and filter the
  output of the 3 YM2149 voices.
  Great work to enhance the sound quality.

- Matthias Arndt <marndt at asmsoftware.de> : Wrote the original version
  of the Hatari user manual, fixed the printer emulation functions.

- Sébastien Molines <clafou at gmail.com> : Wrote the main part of the
  Mac OS X GUI of Hatari.

- Marco Herrn <marco at mherrn.de> : Wrote the initial version of the
  "man" page of Hatari and maintained the Hatari Debian packages until
  Hatari was included into Debian.

- Sven de Marothy : Screenshot functions, the initial CLI debugger,
  the ACSI emulation and added support for ZIPed and GZIPed disk images.

- Emmanuel Anne <emanne at absysteme.fr> : Contributed lots of patches,
  RTC emulation.

- Tuduri Benoît <skweek at users.sourceforge.net> : French man-page,
  support for Doxygen.

- Markus Oberhumer : fixed a problem with ZIPed disk images, routine for
  loading the configuration file from the $HOME directory.

- Philippe Gerin : Fixed a bug in the CPU core (bus errors problem).

- Steve Kemp : Found some possible buffer overflows.

- George Nakos : Helped to track down a bug in the GEMDOS HD emulation.

- Pieter van der Meer : Traced a bug in the VIDEL emulation.

- Patrice Mandin : Some improvements of the autoconf build system files,
  original author of the DSP emulation core.

- Martin Doering : Code for compiling the font data into the executable
  and some other ideas for cleaning up the source code.

- Matthias Alles : He initiated the port of Hatari to MiNT and helped
  with a lot of technical questions about the ST.

- Ventzislav Tzvetkov : Joystick closing patch, Hatari for AmigaOS.

- "Jo" (?) : Patches for compiling Hatari on a 64-bit Alpha machine.

- Stefan Berndtsson <stefan at nocrew.org> : Patches to get Hatari
  running on big endian machines.

- Anatol Paruntik (?) : Patches for compiling Hatari on QNX.

- Claus Windeler <goodoldgames at beemulated.net> : BeOS adaption.

- James Lampard : Adapted Hatari to Acorn RISC OS machines.

- Mark Keates : Patches for compiling Hatari with MinGW.

- Fredrik Noring : Tracked down a bug in the blitter emulation and a
  bug in the PSG shadow register emulation.

- Volker Seebode: Fix to ASCI emulation to get other than AHDI drivers
  working.

- Cyprian Konador: Found some bugs in the blitter cycles emulation,
  duochrome and samplehold modes for TT video emulation.

- Jerome Vernet: Some updates to the OS X Xcode project file and OS X
  GUI, supplied a french keymapping file for OS X.

- Kenneth Kaufman: MS VC6 & C++ compiler and multiple GEMDOS HD
  partition support patches.

- Uwe Seimet: HD Driver related IDE emulation improvements and
  GEMDOS HD emulation improvement suggestions.

- Anders Eriksson (Evil/DHS): Helped improving STE's emulation by
  running many tests programs and providing the source code for some
  non-working demos.

- Markus Fritze: New m68k disassembler with more Motorola like syntax
  and options for controlling how the output looks.

- Deniz Turkoglu: Patches for the Max OS X GUI.

- Markus Heiden: SCSI class 1 (ICD) command support for drives > 1 GB

- nash67: tested hundreds (!) of games from various CD compilations
  and reported the non working ones on atari-forum.com. Huge thanks for
  that tedious work, it helped tracking down some less common cases
  not used in demos (keyboard, joystick, FDC, tos, ...).

- Gilles Fetis: fixes to MMU emulation (from NeXT emulator project
  using Hatari code).

- Peter Putnik (Petari, AtariZoll): for helping with tracking the cause
  of the crash  in Microprose Golf (FDC emulation). Also wrote some useful tools
  to handle floppies (flofor, floimg), as well as opcovat.tos to report
  valid/invalid opcodes with a real CPU and under emulation by testing all possible
  opcode combinations.

- Jean Louis Guerin (DrCoolZic): for the 'Panzer' program, very useful to test
  some FDC behaviours and timings on real hardware and to compare them
  with the emulated system. Also wrote some nice docs on WD1772
  and methods commonly used for games' protections.

- Christer Solskogen: for setting up an automatic build script on his site,
  with up to date binary versions for Linux and Windows in 32 and 64 bit mode.
  Very useful for end users wishing to try the devel version of Hatari, and
  lots of interesting build logs too for various cpu architectures.

- Max Böhm: host <-> Atari filename encoding conversion routines and
  related changes needed to gemdos.c.


 Code from other projects
 ------------------------

As a true open source project, Hatari also uses some code from other
projects which we would like to acknowledge here:

- Most of the original ST hardware emulation comes from the WinSTon
  source code which has been written by Paul Bates.
  (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/)

- The original CPU core has been taken from UAE which has been written
  by Bernd Schmidt and others. (http://uae.coresystems.de/)

- The new alternative CPU core has been taken from WinUAE.
  (http://www.winuae.net/)

- Some parts have been taken from the emulator STonX that has been
  written by Marinos Yannikos and Martin Griffiths.
  (http://stonx.sourceforge.net/)

- A lot of code (e.g. the scancode keyboard mapping, Videl, NVRAM and
  DSP emulation) has been adapted from the sources of the emulator
  Aranym. (http://aranym.atari.org/)

- The code for decompressing ZIP files (unzip.c) has been taken from
  Gilles Vollant's miniunzip program.
  (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html)

- The routines for saving and loading the ASCII configuration file
  (cfgopts.c) have originally been written by Jeffry J. Brickley.

- The new sound core uses (or used) some code/ideas from the following GPL
  projects :
  * 5 bits volume table and 16*16*16 combinations of all volume are
    from Sc68 by Benjamin Gerard.
  * 4 bits to 5 bits volume interpolation from 16*16*16 to 32*32*32
    are from YM blep synthesis by Antti Lankila.
  * Since Hatari 1.7, volume table based on measures by Paulo Simoes

- The IDE hard disk emulation is based on code from QEMU.
  (http://www.qemu.org/)

- The MMU emulation for the 68030 has been taken from the NeXT emulator
  Previous (thanks to Andreas Grabher!)
