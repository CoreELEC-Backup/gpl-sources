                      Usually you don't have to create a config file
                      yourself. As distributed, the lircd.conf.d contains
                      a file devinput.lircd.dist. This can be used by
                      renaming it to devinput.lircd.conf. If required, the
                      config file can be re-generated using
                      <a href="lirc-make-devinput">lirc-make-devinput</a>.

                      This driver uses <em>/dev/input/event0</em> as
                      its input device per default. You should provide
                      the correct device as --device parameter on the
                      lircd and irrecord command line.

                      The driver supports enumerating the available
                      devices using <i>mode2 --driver devinput
                      --list-devices</i>.

                      Sometimes the input device mapping changes
                      between system reboots. In that case it is
                      possible to specify the correct input device by
                      its name or physical location by preceding the
                      desired value with <em>name=</em> or
                      <em>phys=</em>. See the
                      <a href="configuration-guide.html#appendix-6">
                      Configuration Guide.</a></p>
                    <p>
                      In simple setups, where there is just one device
                      available (i. e., there is just a single
                      /sys/class/rc/rc0 directory) the device can be
                      given as <em>auto</em>.</p>
                    <p>
                      The devices under /dev/input are often writable
                      for some group. On Fedora, current user can be given
                      access to these devices using <i>usermod -aG input $USER</i>,
                      which adds the input group to the grouplist of current
                      user.  Other distros have similar steps.</p>
