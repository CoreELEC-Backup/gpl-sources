    Marks yourself as 'away'; this method is used to inform people that you
    are not paying attention to your screen.

    You might use it when you are taking a nap, in the shower, getting some
    food, or otherwise engaged. When you're 'away' you will see '(zZzZ)' in
    your statusbar.

    Anyone who does a WHOIS on your nickname will see that you are away, as
    well as your away message.
