ChangeLog:
----------
2020-05-17:
  - Bump version to 20200517
  - Added parameter -i to override the default charset for strings in SDT
  - Created a special handling for string encoding for ORF (fix Issue #8 on Github project page)
  - Fixed missing ac3 radio channels in Xine output (Issue #10 on Github project page)
  - Fixed wrong parameter hint in output (Issue #9 on Github project page) 
2020-05-02:
  - Manual reset of fe_status (thanks to HelmutB for reporting)
  - Ignore descriptors in NIT that do not fit the delivery system (thanks to HelmutB for reporting)
  - Use more reasonable filter timeouts (HelmutB reported the too long >30 seconds for PAT)
  - Change the verbosity level of some messages to make simply -v more usable
2020-05-01:
  - Version string 20200501 for new work (release 0.6 has string 20200430)
  - -p parameter can now take a comma-separated list of PLP IDs. They are scanned in the order
     they appear in the list. 
     - Default is -1,0,1 for most countries, -1,1,0 for AT and IT, -1,0,1,2,3 for Russia. 
     - PLPs found via -1 are not scanned again 
       (unless -U is used to avoid updating parameters from NIT). 
     - If a network is found on a PLP (can be -1) and then again on a different PLP, but on the 
       same frequency, then the PLP for the network is updated instead of creating a duplicate.
       This is useful if scan starts with PLP ID -1 and NIT contains a wrong value for PLP ID.
     - If there is no signal at all found with the first PLP, it's assumed there is not DVB-T2 on 
       the frequency. If there is a signal, but no data / no lock, next PLPs are tried.
     - A parameter for "fast scanning" to stop as soon as services are found on one PLP will be 
       added at some a later time (hopefully soon). At the moment, due to the additionally 
       scanned PLPs, scan may take longer than with t2scan version 0.6. You can work this around
       (at the expense of potentially not finding all services and having short channel strings) 
       by using "-p-1 -U" (or "-p-1" if you trust the PLP IDs in the NIT enough).
2020-04-30:
  - Set default channel list to all VHF and UHF channels 
    (for AT, BE, CH, LU, NL, FR, GB only UHF channels 21-60 will be scanned by default) 
2020-04-23:
  - Added support for autodetection of PLP ID (use -p-1)
  - Set default PLP ID for Italy to 1
2019-03-17:
  - bump version number to 20190317 for 0.5 release and to 20190318 for post-0.5 release work
2019-01-20:
  - More clean-up.
  - Make some debugging messages in descriptor parsing less verbose
  - re-add more code from w_scan for ATSC; ATSC scan still untested (may work or may not)
2019-01-19:
  - Remove now unused code from w_scan for DVB-C, which is not supported in t2scan
  - Re-add some previously removed code for ATSC; ATSC scan is still completely untested
  - Smaller documentation fixes
2019-01-13:
  - Check if frontend is in good status after open. Don't start scan if it is not.
  - When having checked which frontend to use, sleep 500ms before the selected one is opened again 
2019-01-06:
  - Fixed tuning timeout code (thanks to GTC for the patch)
  - Set default PLP for Austria to 1. "-p" can still be used to override that.
  - Remove parameter for using long filter timout. Now always use an even longer timeout
    (makes sure that also channels with my services on it are scanned it correctly)
  - bump version number to 20190106
2018-07-17:
 - Added parameter "-p" to specify the PLP ID for DVB-T2. In Germany, some
   "connect" channels are under PLP 1, which can now be found with t2scan.
2018-04-21
 - Changed version string to 20180421 for the 0.3 release
 - fixed problem that some audio pids were not included in vdr output
 - option "-d" to mark duplicate multiplexed and services 
   and "-D" to remove such duplicates automatically  
2018-03-30
 - refactor the options:
    - "-c" and "-C" (for *c*hannel) to determine lowest and highest channel
    - The old "-c" has been renamed to "-Y" (for countr*y*)
    - One parameter "-o" for output format, and one "-O" for the type of 
      services to be included in output. Also "-E" to omit encrypted services.
    - For Europe (incl. France and GB) we use now a channel list with only
      UHF channels below 790 MHz and don't use offsets. Added an option "-L"
      to override the channel list if needed.
    - Use vdr 2.1.x format as default output (can be changed with "-o").
    - Worked on help ("-h") and expert help ("-H").
    - Changed version string to 20180403.
    - Created files README, COPYING and NEWS to make sure the build process
      works for more Linux distributions (e.g. Gentoo).
2018-03-28
 - creating first release. The differences between t2scan and w_scan are:
    - Simplified scanning: The scan happens in one run and the NIT is only used
      to get the parameters of the *current* channel. This design decision was
      made since I noticed that often the NIT data referring to other channels
      is not reliable for DVB-T/T2, leading to channels not being found or
      having wrong IDs resulting in a non-working EPG in vdr. The approach
      should work with most current DVB-T/T2 cards since they can autodetect
      most parameters of a transponder when tuning. For DVB-S, this approach 
      would result in many channels not being found, therefore I removed DVB-S
      (and -C) support.
   - Added a parameter to determing the DVB-T type for scan ("-t1" for DVB-T
     only, "-t2" for DVB-T2 only). This makes the scan much faster if the user
     knows that only one DVB-T type is used in the user's region. The option
     for the tuning speed ("-t" in w_scan) has been changed to "-s".
   - Added a parameter to determine the lowest channel to scan ("-k") and the
     highest channel to scan ("-K"). This makes the scan much faster if the
     user knows which channels are used in the user's region.
   - Only DVB-T/T2 (ATSC available, but untested), support for DVB-C and
     DVB-S/S2 has been removed.
   - Removed several options, trying to keep this tool very simple.


2017-04-08
 - start work on initial version using wirbel's w_scan, simplifying it, and
   removing sat support
