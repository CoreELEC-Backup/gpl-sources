LIRC plugindocs README
======================

This directory is a dumping ground where plugins compiled out-of-tree can
store documentation. It's not used in any particular way by the main
lirc installation, but is exported using the pkg-config 'plugindocs'
variable.

The plugindocs.mk file provided here can be included and used with
'make update'. This will format complete pages in the main html
directory from sources here, and also update the programs.html index.
