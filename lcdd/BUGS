Known Bugs:
--------------

V0.5dev:
  - If vBars are used together with ICON_BLOCK_FILLED on the same screen and
    that icon is implemented as a custom char, it sometimes is replaced with
    a non full block from the vBar. Affected drivers: IOWarrior, CwLinux
  - The lcdproc client currently ignores errors from the machine dependent
    functions. This may result in strange behaviour of the screens or core
    dumps.


Bugs in previous versions (not checked if the still exist):
-----------------------------------------------------------

  - On Solaris the mtc_s16209x driver fails to compile. Configure LCDproc to
    exclude this driver.
  - A client may cause the connection to LCDd to break or even crash
    LCDd by not reading the replies from LCDd
         See one of the example clients (clients/examples) for details.
  - MtxOrb driver
       - "lcdproc K" does not display properly in between digit.
  - The server tends to crash if the joystick driver is the last one loaded.
    Specifically, if the "E" key is pressed...
