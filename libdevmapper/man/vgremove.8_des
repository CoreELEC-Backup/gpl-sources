vgremove removes one or more VGs. If LVs exist in the VG, a prompt is used
to confirm LV removal.

If one or more PVs in the VG are lost, consider
\fBvgreduce --removemissing\fP to make the VG
metadata consistent again.

Repeat the force option (\fB-ff\fP) to forcibly remove LVs in the VG
without confirmation.
