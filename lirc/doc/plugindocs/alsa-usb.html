    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Using the alsa_usb driver</H1>

    <P>
      First make sure that you have the correct version of <A
      HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</A> installed (for the
      SB Extigy/Audigy, this is 1.0.9). The alsa_usb module relies on
      the alsa device names. /proc/asound/cards lists the number and
      name of each recognized soundcard:

~ # cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [Extigy         ]: USB-Audio - Sound Blaster Extigy
                     Creative Technology Ltd. Sound Blaster Extigy [...]
1 [I82801DBICH4   ]: ICH4 - Intel 82801DB-ICH4
                     Intel 82801DB-ICH4 with AD1981B at 0x24000800, irq 11

    <P>
      You need to pass the number or name prefixed with a hw: to
      lircd. In this case lircd -d hw:0 or lircd -d hw:Extigy. It is
      recommended to use the name, since it is independent of the
      order in which the devices are discovered and lircd will exit,
      if the Extigy is not connected.
