/**
 * A reimplementation of itoa(), as this is not available
 * on all platforms. We used the chance to make an interface
 * that fits us well, so it is no longer plain itoa().
 *
 * This method works with the US-ASCII alphabet. If you port this
 * to e.g. EBCDIC, you need to make a small adjustment. Keep in mind,
 * that on the wire it MUST be US-ASCII, so basically all you need
 * to do is replace the constant '0' with 0x30 ;).
 *
 * \param pBuf Caller-provided buffer that will receive the
 *              generated ASCII string.
 *
 * \param iLenBuf Length of the caller-provided buffer.
 *
 * \param iToConv The integer to be converted.
