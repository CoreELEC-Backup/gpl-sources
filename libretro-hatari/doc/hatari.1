.SH "NAME"
hatari \- Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B hatari
.RI  [options]
.RI  [directory|diskimage|program]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and
other Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
.PP
With hatari one can run games, demos or applications written for Atari
ST, STE or Falcon.  Atari TT support is experimental.  Hatari supports
the commonly used *.st and *.msa disk images and hard disk emulation.
.PP
To run the emulator a TOS ROM image is needed. EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS is shipped with hatari. Since it is not yet
fully compatible with the original TOS, some programs won't run
correctly with it. Because of this it is recommended to use a TOS
ROM from a real Atari.
.PP
As an argument one can give either a name of a directory that should
be emulated as a virtual GEMDOS hard disk, a floppy disk image or an
Atari program that should be autostarted.  In the last case the
program's directory will be used as the C: drive from where this
program will be started.
.PP
Booting will be done from the disk image or directory that's given
last on the command line as an option or the argument (and which
corresponds to A: or C:). If you want to give floppy image name with
an autostarting program name, give it with --disk-a option before the
program name.

.SH "OPTIONS"
Hatari options are split into several categories:

.SH "General options"
.TP 
.B \-h, \-\-help

.TP 
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print version information and terminate
.TP 
.B \-\-confirm\-quit <bool>
Whether Hatari confirms quitting
.TP 
.B \-c, \-\-configfile <filename>
Read additional configuration values from <file>, these
override values read from the global and user configuration
files
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keymap <file>
Load keyboard mapping from <file>
.TP 
.B \-\-fast\-forward <bool>
On fast machine helps skipping (fast forwarding) Hatari output

.SH "Common display options"
.TP 
.B \-m, \-\-mono
Start in monochrome mode instead of color
.TP 
.B \-\-monitor <x>
Select monitor type (x = mono/rgb/vga/tv)
.TP 
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
Start the emulator in fullscreen mode
.TP 
.B \-w, \-\-window
Start the emulator in windowed mode
.TP 
.B \-\-grab
Grab mouse (also) in windowed mode
.TP 
.B \-\-borders <bool>
Show ST/STE/Falcon screen borders (for low/med resolution overscan demos)
.TP 
.B \-\-frameskips <x>
Skip <x> frames after each displayed frame to accelerate emulation
(0=disabled, >4 uses automatic frameskip with given value as maximum)
.TP
.B \-\-slowdown <x>
Slow down emulation by factor of x (used as multiplier for VBL wait time)
.TP 
.B \-\-statusbar <bool>
Show statusbar (with floppy leds etc etc)
.TP 
.B \-\-drive\-led <bool>
Show overlay drive led when statusbar isn't shown
.TP
.B \-\-max\-width <x>
Preferred / maximum window width for borders / zooming
.TP
.B \-\-max\-height <x>
Preferred / maximum window height for borders / zooming
.TP
.B \-\-bpp <bool>
Force internal bitdepth (x = 8/15/16/32, 0=disable)

.SH "ST/STE specific display options"
.TP
.B \-\-desktop\-st <bool>
Whether fullscreen mode uses desktop resolution to avoid: messing
multi-screen setups, several seconds delay needed by LCD monitors
resolution switching and the resulting sound break. As Hatari ST/E
display code doesn't support zooming (except low-rez doubling), it
doesn't get scaled (by Hatari or monitor) when this is enabled.
Therefore this is mainly useful only if you suffer from the described
effects, but still want to grab mouse and remove other distractions
from the screen just by toggling fullscreen mode. (disabled by default)
.TP 
.B \-\-spec512 <x>
Hatari uses this threshold to decide when to render a screen with
the slower but more accurate Spectrum512 screen conversion functions
(0 <= x <= 512, 0=disable)
.TP 
.B \-z, \-\-zoom <x>
Zoom (double) low resolution (1=no, 2=yes)

.SH "TT/Falcon specific display options"
Zooming to sizes specified below is internally done using integer scaling
factors. This means that different Atari resolutions may show up with
different sizes, but they are never blurry.
.TP 
.B \-\-desktop <bool>
Whether to use desktop resolution on fullscreen to avoid issues
related to resolution switching. Otherwise fullscreen will use
a resolution that is closest to the Hatari window size.
(enabled by default)
.TP
.B \-\-force\-max <bool>
Hatari window size is forced to specified maximum size and black borders
used when Atari resolution doesn't scale evenly to it.  This is most
useful when recording videos of Falcon demos that change their
resolution. (disabled by default)
.TP
.B \-\-aspect <bool>
Whether to do monitor aspect ratio correction (enabled by default)

.SH "VDI options"
.TP
.B \-\-vdi <bool>

write protection is according to the disk image file attributes
.TP
.B \-\-protect\-hd <x>
Write protect harddrive <dir> contents (on/off/auto). With "auto" option
the protection can be controlled by setting individual files attributes
as it disables the file attribute modifications for the GEMDOS hard disk
emulation
.TP
.B \-\-gemdos\-case <x>
Specify whether new dir/filenames are forced to be in upper or lower case
with the GEMDOS HD emulation. Off/upper/lower, off by default
.TP 
.B \-d, \-\-harddrive <dir>
Emulate harddrive partition(s) with <dir> contents.  If directory
contains only single letter (C-Z) subdirectories, each of these
subdirectories will be treated as a separate partition, otherwise the
given directory itself will be assigned to drive "C:". In the multiple
partition case, the letters used as the subdirectory names will
determine to which drives/partitions they're assigned. If <dir> is
an empty string, then harddrive's emulation is disabled
.TP
.B \-\-acsi <file>
Emulate an ACSI hard disk with an image <file>
.TP 
.B \-\-ide\-master <file>
Emulate an IDE master hard disk with an image <file>

.TP 
.B \-t, \-\-tos <imagefile>
Specify TOS ROM image to use
.TP 
.B \-\-patch\-tos <bool>
Use this option to enable/disable TOS ROM patching. Experts only! Leave
this enabled unless you know what you are doing!
.TP 
.B \-\-cartridge <imagefile>
Use ROM cartridge image <file> (only works if GEMDOS HD emulation and
extended VDI resolution are disabled)

.SH "CPU options"
.TP

.TP 
.B \-\-cpuclock <x>
Set the CPU clock (8, 16 or 32 Mhz)
.TP 
.B \-\-compatible <bool>
Use a more compatible, but slower 68000 CPU mode with
better prefetch accuracy and cycle counting

.SH "Misc system options"
.TP 
.B \-\-machine <x>
Select machine type (x = st, ste, tt or falcon)
.TP 
.B \-\-blitter <bool>
Enable blitter emulation (ST only)
.TP 
.B \-\-dsp <x>
Falcon DSP emulation (x = none, dummy or emu, Falcon only)
.TP 
.B \-\-timer\-d <bool>
Patch redundantly high Timer-D frequency set by TOS.  This about doubles
Hatari speed (for ST/e emulation) as the original Timer-D frequency causes
most of the interrupts.
.TP
.B \-\-fast\-boot <bool>
Patch TOS and initialize the so-called "memvalid" system variables to by-pass
the memory test of TOS, so that the system boots faster.
.TP
.B \-\-rtc <bool>
Enable real-time clock

.SH "Sound options"
.TP 
.B \-\-mic <bool>
Enable/disable (Falcon only) microphone
.TP 
.B \-\-sound <x>
Sound frequency: 6000-50066. "off" disables the sound and speeds up
the emulation. To prevent extra sound artifacts, the frequency should be
selected so that it either matches evenly with the STE/TT/Falcon sound
DMA (6258, 12517, 250033, 50066 Hz) or your sound card frequencies
(11025, 22050, 44100 or 6000...48000 Hz).  Check what your sound card
supports.
.TP 
.B \-\-sound\-buffer\-size <x>
SDL's sound buffer size: 10-100, or 0 to use default buffer size.
By default Hatari uses an SDL buffer size of 1024 samples, which
gives approximatively 20-30 ms of sound depending on the chosen sound
frequency. Under some OS or with not fully supported sound card, this
default setting can cause a bigger delay at lower frequency (nearly 0.5 sec).
In that case, you can use this option to force the size of the sound
buffer to a fixed number of milliseconds of sound (using 20 is often
a good choice if you have such problems). Most users will not need this option.
.TP 
.B \-\-sound\-sync <bool>
The emulation rate is nudged by +100 or 0 or \-100 micro-seconds on occasion.
This prevents the sound buffer from overflowing (long latency and
lost samples) or underflowing (short latency and repeated samples).
The emulation rate smoothly deviates by a maximum of 0.58% until
synchronized, while the emulator continuously generates every sound
sample and the crystal controlled sound system consumes every sample.
.br
(on|off, off=default)
.TP 
.B \-\-ym\-mixing <x>
Select a method for mixing the three YM2149 voice volumes together.
"model" uses a mathematical model of the YM voices,
"table" uses a lookup table of audio output voltage values measured
on STF and "linear" just averages the 3 YM voices.

.SH "Debug options"
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-wincon
Open console window (Windows only)
.TP 
.B \-D, \-\-debug
Toggle whether CPU exceptions invoke the debugger
.TP 
.B \-\-debug\-except <flags>
Specify which exceptions invoke debugger, see
.B \-\-debug\-except help
for available (comma separated) exception flags.
.TP 
.B \-\-bios\-intercept
Toggle XBios command parsing. Allows Atari programs to use all Hatari
functionality and change Hatari state through Hatari specifit
XBios(255) calls. XBios(20) printscreen calls produce also Hatari
screenshots.
.TP
.B \-\-conout <device>
Enable console (xconout vector functions) output redirection for given
<device> to host terminal.  Device 2 is for the (CON:) VT52 console,
which vector function catches also EmuTOS panic messages and MiNT
console output, not just normal BIOS console output.
.TP
.B \-\-disasm <x>
Set disassembly options.  'uae' and 'ext' select the dissasembly engine
to use, bitmask sets output options for the external disassembly engine
and 'help' lists them.
.TP 
.B \-\-natfeats <bool>
Enable/disable (basic) Native Features support.
E.g. EmuTOS uses it for debug output.
.TP
.B \-\-trace <flags>
Activate debug traces, see
.B \-\-trace help
for available (comma separated) tracing flags
.TP
.B \-\-trace\-file <file>
Save trace output to <file> (default=stderr)
.TP
.B \-\-parse <file>
Parse/execute debugger commands from <file>
.TP
.B \-\-saveconfig
Save Hatari configuration and exit. Hatari UI needs Hatari configuration
file to start, this can be used to create it automatically.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-parachute
Disable SDL parachute to get Hatari core dumps. SDL parachute is enabled
by default to restore video mode in case Hatari terminates abnormally
while using non-standard screen resolution.
.TP
.B \-\-control\-socket <file>
Hatari reads options from given socket at run-time
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file <file>
Save log output to <file> (default=stderr)
.TP
.B \-\-log\-level <x>
Log output level (x=debug/todo/info/warn/error/fatal)
.TP
.B \-\-alert\-level <x>
Show dialog for log messages above given level
.TP
.B \-\-run\-vbls <x>
Exit after X VBLs

.SH "KEYBOARD HANDLING"
Hatari provides special keys for different purposes.

.SH "Emulated Atari ST keyboard"
All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so
pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the
SPACE key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings:
.TP
.B  Alt
will act as the ST's ALTERNATE key
.TP
.B  left Ctrl
will act as the ST's CONTROL key
.TP
.B  Page Up
will emulate the ST's HELP key
.TP
.B  Page Down
will emulate the ST's UNDO key
.PP
.B AltGr
will act as
.B Alternate
as well as long as you do not press it together with a Hatari hotkey
combination.
.PP
The 
.B right Ctrl
key is used as the fire button of the emulated joystick when you turn
on joystick emulation via keyboard. 
.PP
The cursor keys will act as the cursor keys on the Atari ST as long as
joystick emulation via keyboard has been turned off.

.SH "Keyboard shortcuts during emulation"
The shortcut keys can be configured in the configuration file.
The default settings are:
.TP
.B AltGr + a
record animation
.TP
.B AltGr + g
grab a screenshot
.TP
.B AltGr + i
boss key: leave full screen mode and iconify window
.TP
.B AltGr + m
(un-)lock the mouse into the window
.TP
.B AltGr + r
warm reset the ST (same as the reset button)
.TP
.B AltGr + c
cold reset the ST (same as the power switch)
.TP
.B AltGr + d
open dialog to select/change disk A
.TP
.B AltGr + s
enable/disable sound
.TP
.B AltGr + q
quit the emulator
.TP
.B AltGr + x
toggle normal/max speed
.TP
.B AltGr + y
enable/disable sound recording
.TP
.B AltGr + k
save memory snapshot
.TP
.B AltGr + l

.B AltGr + F1
switch joystick type on joy port 0
.B AltGr + F2
switch joystick type on joy port 1
.B AltGr + F3
switch joystick type for joypad A
.B AltGr + F3
switch joystick type for joypad B
.TP
.B F11
toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode
.TP
.B F12 
activate the hatari options GUI
.br
You may need to hold SHIFT down while in windowed mode.
.TP
.B Pause
Pauses the emulation
.TP
.B AltGr + Pause
Invokes the internal Hatari debugger

.SH "Keyboard shortcuts for SDL GUI"
There are multiple ways to interact with the SDL GUI.
.PP
TAB and cursor keys change focus between UI elements.  Additionally
Home key moves focus to first item, End key to last one.  Initially
focus is on default UI element, but focus changes are remembered
between dialog invocations. Enter and Space invoke focused item. UI
elements with underlined characters can be invoked directly with Alt +
key with that character.  Alt + arrow keys will act on arrow buttons.
.PP
Most importantly:
.TP
.B Options GUI main view
Enter accepts configuration, ESC cancels it.
.TP
.B Options GUI dialogs
Enter (or End+Enter if focus was moved) returns back to main view.
.TP
.B Fileselector
Page up and down keys scroll the file list.  Enter on focused file
name selects it.  Enter on OK button accepts the selected file. ESC
cancels the dialog/selection.
.TP
.B Alert dialogs
Enter accepts and ESC cancels the dialog.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
