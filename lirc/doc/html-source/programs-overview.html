    <p>
    LIRC contains a quite large number of tools.  This chapter tries to
    provide an overview.


    <h3>User programs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="irsend.html">irsend</a> sends data using
         lirc from the command line.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="irpty.html">irpty</a> emulates keyboard
         input from a tty using a remote. </li>
      <li>
         <a href="irrecord.html">irrecord</a> can create a new
         lircd.conf for a remote which isn't available in the database.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Daemons</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="lircd.html">lircd</a> is the main LIRC daemon and runs
         as a systemd service. It usually reads from a kernel device like
         /dev/lirc0 or /dev/ttyACM0 and presents the decoded data on an
         output socket like /var/run/lirc/lircd.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lircrcd.html">lircrcd</a> is a helper daemon which
         coordinates the LIRC state as defined in lircrc in different
         clients. It's managed, started  and stopped by lircd.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lircmd.html">lircmd</a> runs as a systemd service.
         It reads data from the lircd output socket and generates
         mouse events, so that a remote can emulate a mouse.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="irexec.html">irexec</a> normally runs as a user
         daemon in the session. It is used to run arbitrary commands
         on various button presses.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lircd-uinput.html">lircd-uinput</a> connects
         to the lircd output socket and forwards the decoded button
         presses to the kernel uinput device. This makes the lirc
         events available to other applications in the same way as
         events from other input devices.
      <li>
         <a href="lircd-setup.html">lircd-setup</a> is a small,
         one-shot program which runs commands as root before
         starting  <a href="lircd.html">lircd</a> .
     </ul>
    <a name="config"/>
    <h3>Configuration tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="irdb-get.html">irdb-get</a> can list, search and
         download lircd.conf remote configuration files from the
         <a href="http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes">remotes database</a>.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lirc-setup.html">lirc-setup</a> is a GUI tool
         which can create the different configuration files after some
         user dialogs.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lirc-lsplugins.html">lirc-lsplugins</a> lists the plugins
         and drivers which are actually available in an installation. It
         also provides info on the drivers, including drivers that can't be
         loaded.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lirc-lsremotes.html">lirc-lsremotes</a> can parse
         lircd.conf configuration files and act as a static checker. It is
         also used to provide dense, parseable keyword information about
         remote config files.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lirc-config-tool.html">lirc-config-tool</a> can generate
         a first shot for lircrc configuration file for some applications.
         It can also be used to sanitize old lircd.conf files which does
         not use symbols from the official namespace.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="lirc-make-devinput.html">lirc-make-devinput</a> can
         generate a site-specific devinput.lircd.conf configuration file.
    </ul>

    <h3>Test and debug tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="mode2.html">mode2</a> monitors the data sent from
         the kernel to lircd. It displays either timing information or, if
         the hardware decodes the signals, the decoded values.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="irw.html">irw</a> monitors the data sent from lircd to
         the applications, normally in the /var/run/lirc/lircd socket. </li>
      <li>
         <a href="ircat.html">ircat</a> connects to same socket as irw. However,
         it displays the application strings delivered to the application after
         mapping the lircd output using the lircrc file. </li>
      <li>
         <a href="irpipe.html">irpipe</a> works together with the irpipe kernel
         driver. It can be used to feed data to lircd which it can read on
         /dev/irpipe0. This device works the same way as /dev/lirc0 as seen
         from lircd. </li>
      <li>
         <a href="irsimsend.html">irsimsend</a> can "send" data using a
         lircd.conf configuration file and store the data (pulse/space
         durations) in a file. This file can be used with irpipe to send
         the same data to lircd.</li>
      <li>
         <a href="irsimreceive.html">irsimreceive</a> can "receive" from a file
         e. g., created by mode2(1) or irsimrecieve(1).</li>
      <li>
         <a href="irtestcase.html">irtestcase</a> can log the data from
         a remote together with the decoded symbols. It can also send the
         data to lircd and check that the decoded symbols matches the
         logged ones. </li>
      <li>
         <a href="irtext2udp.html">irtext2udp</a> converts regular, printable
         timing data to the binary format used by the

     </ul>
    <a name="drivers"/>
