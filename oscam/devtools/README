The idea of devtools directory is to collect tools that are useful for
OSCam coders during development or tools used in the oscam build.

These tools are not meant to be used by OSCam users.

Currently available tools are:

  check_config_tables.sh                This script checks config tables
                                        against variable defintions
                                        in order to find wrong types.

  check_cmdline_opts.sh                 This script checks if all command
                                        line parameters are properly set.

  extract_config.sh                     This script extracts OSCam build
                                        config from oscam binary.
