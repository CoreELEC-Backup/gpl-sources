/*! \file stringbuf.h
 *  \brief The dynamic stringt buffer helper object.
 *
 * The string buffer object is a slim string handler. It implements
 * a dynamically growing string and can be used whereever data needs
 * to be appended to a string AND it is not known how large the
 * resulting structure is. If you know the string size or can
 * retrieve it quickly, you should NOT use the string buffer
 * object - because it has some overhead not associated with direct
 * string manipulations.
 *
 * This object is used to grow a string. For performance reasons,
 * the termination \0 byte is only written after the caller 
 * indicates the string is completed.
