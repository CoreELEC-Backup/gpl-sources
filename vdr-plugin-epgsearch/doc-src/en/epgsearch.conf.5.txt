=head1 NAME

F<epgsearch.conf> - The searchtimers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains the searchtimers.

Do not edit it manually, you should use SVDRP.

=head1 SYNTAX

Due to some new features there was a change in the format. The format
is now signed with a comment in the first line. The field delimiter
is B<':'>:

  1 - unique search timer id
  2 - the search term
  3 - use time? 0/1
  4 - start time in HHMM
  5 - stop time in HHMM
  6 - use channel? 0 = no,  1 = Interval, 2 = Channel group, 3 = FTA only
  7 - if 'use channel' = 1 then channel id[|channel id] in VDR format,
      one entry or min/max entry separated with |, if 'use channel' = 2
      then the channel group name
  8 - match case? 0/1
  9 - search mode:
      0 - the whole term must appear as substring
      1 - all single terms (delimiters are blank,',', ';', '|' or '~')
          must exist as substrings.
      2 - at least one term (delimiters are blank, ',', ';', '|' or '~')
          must exist as substring.
      3 - matches exactly
      4 - regular expression
 10 - use title? 0/1
 11 - use subtitle? 0/1
 12 - use description? 0/1
 13 - use duration? 0/1
 14 - min duration in hhmm
 15 - max duration in hhmm
 16 - use as search timer? 0/1
 17 - use day of week? 0/1
 18 - day of week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday...;
      -1 Sunday, -2 Monday, -4 Tuesday, ...; -7 Sun, Mon, Tue)
 19 - use series recording? 0/1
 20 - directory for recording
 21 - priority of recording
 22 - lifetime of recording
 23 - time margin for start in minutes
 24 - time margin for stop in minutes
 25 - use VPS? 0/1
 26 - action:
      0 = create a timer
      1 = announce only via OSD (no timer)
      2 = switch only (no timer)
      3 = announce via OSD and switch (no timer)
      4 = announce via mail
 27 - use extended EPG info? 0/1
 28 - extended EPG info values. This entry has the following format
      (delimiter is '|' for each category, '#' separates id and value):
      1 - the id of the extended EPG info category as specified in
          epgsearchcats.conf
      2 - the value of the extended EPG info category
          (a ':' will be translated to "!^colon^!", e.g. in "16:9")
 29 - avoid repeats? 0/1
 30 - allowed repeats
 31 - compare title when testing for a repeat? 0/1
 32 - compare subtitle when testing for a repeat? 0/1/2
      0 - no
      1 - yes
      2 - yes, if present
 33 - compare description when testing for a repeat? 0/1
 34 - compare extended EPG info when testing for a repeat?
      This entry is a bit field of the category IDs.
 35 - accepts repeats only within x days
 36 - delete a recording automatically after x days
 37 - but keep this number of recordings anyway
 38 - minutes before switch (if action = 2)
 39 - pause if x recordings already exist
 40 - blacklist usage mode (0 none, 1 selection, 2 all)
 41 - selected blacklist IDs separated with '|'
 42 - fuzzy tolerance value for fuzzy searching
 43 - use this search in favorites menu (0 no, 1 yes)
 44 - id of a menu search template
 45 - auto deletion mode (0 don't delete search timer, 1 delete after given
      count of recordings, 2 delete after given days after first recording)
 46 - count of recordings after which to delete the search timer
 47 - count of days after the first recording after which to delete the search
      timer
 48 - first day where the search timer is active (see parameter 16)
 49 - last day where the search timer is active (see parameter 16)
 50 - ignore missing EPG categories? 0/1
 51 - unmute sound if off when used as switch timer
 52 - percentage of match when comparing the summary of two events (with 'avoid repeats')
 53 - HEX representation of the content descriptors, each descriptor ID is represented with 2 chars
 54 - compare date when testing for a repeat? (0=no, 1=same day, 2=same week, 3=same month)

A ':' in the search term or the directory entry will be translated in a
'|'. If a '|' exists in the search term, e.g. when using regular
expressions, it will be translated to "!^pipe^!" (I know it's ugly ;-))

There's no need to fill all fields, only the first 11 fields must exist.
