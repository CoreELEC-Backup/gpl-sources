Hello,

In theory the driver could be made to send the DEC the reset sequence when
all devices were closed.  However, due to the awkwardness of switching
between slave and stand-alone mode, I've decided against this.  Hence this
application, which I hope provides the user a nice compromise between
control and ease-of-use.

ttusb_dec_reset is a small utility for resetting a ttusb-dec device to
stand-alone mode after use.  It requires libusb, which can be found here:

http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

There is probably a package for it included with your linux distribution
though.

For the utility to reset a device, it must have permission to access the usb
device, and the device must not be claimed by anything else.  That means that
the ttusb-dec module must be rmmoded before using this utility.  You probably
want to have turned off any hotplug mechanisms before running the utility
or the device will likely get taken over again once it comes back up.  Or you
could just yank the usb cable out.

The utility takes no arguments, you just run it:
./ttusb_dec_reset

Cheers,
Alex
