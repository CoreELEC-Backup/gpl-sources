Hi there,

atsc_epg is a small utility for obtaining information such as programs, EPG 
(electronic program guide) from an ATSC channel. 

Pulling the detailed information, i.e., option '-t', may take fairly long 
time, or never ending, which is a bug of the PSIP generator. Ctrl+C can be 
used to abort and the received parts will be printed.

Enjoy,
Yufei
