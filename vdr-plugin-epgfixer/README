Requirements:
 - VDR 1.7.26 or later
 - PCRE library

Description:

Epgfixer is a VDR plugin for doing extra fixing of EPG data.

Features:

- Modifying EPG data using regular expressions. Correctly named back references
  are placed to the named EPG field.
- Character set conversions for channel using incorrect encoding.
- Blacklists for ignoring EPG data from stream.
- Regular expressions, character set conversions and blacklists can be applied to 
  either all channels or only to selected channels.
- Cloning EPG data from one channel to another.
- Removing HTML tags and replacing HTML characters with matching regular
  characters in EPG data.
- Editing all settings through setup menu.
- EPG bug fixes included in VDR individually selectable from
  setup menu.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-epgfixer-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s epgfixer-X.Y.Z epgfixer
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
make
make install
./vdr -P epgfixer

Configuration:

Regular expressions, character set conversions, blacklists and EPG clonings
are defined in regexp.conf, charset.conf, blacklist.conf and epgclone.conf,
respectively, located in "epgfixer" subdirectory of VDR's configuration 
directory for plugins. Check the example configuration files under "epgfixer"
subdirectory for further information.

General syntax of configuration files:
- Lines beginning with # are regarded as comments.
- Lines beginning with ! are regarded as disabled lines.
- Channel_list is optional comma separated list of channels for which the line
  is used. If no list of channels is given the line is used for all channels.
- Channel_list can contain either channel IDs (e.g. S19.2E-1-1089-12003-0) or
  numbers but not both.
- Channel intervals (e.g. 1-10) can be used for channel numbers.

Syntax of regexp.conf line is 
"Channel_list:Parsed_field?Conditional_field~Conditional_Regexp=Regexp" with:
- Parsed_field is the EPG field for which the regular expression is applied
  with available field names title, shorttext and description.
- Conditional_field and Conditional_Regexp are optional parameters to control 
  when Regexp is applied.
- Conditional_field is identical to Parsed_field.
- Conditional_Regexp has to be a Perl-style 'm/PATTERN/' as described below
  except it is only used for matching (i.e. backreferences are ignored).
- Regular expressions can be used in different ways: Perl-style 
  's/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/' and 'm/PATTERN/' operators or simply using 'PATTERN'
  of which the latter two use named backreferences.
- Regular expressions use named backreferences with either title, shorttext,
  description or rating (parental rating).
- By prepending "a" or "p" to backreference name (except rating field) the
  back referenced string is either appended or prepended to the original
  content of the target EPG field, respectively.
- Perl-style operator 's/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/' replaces match of PATTERN with
  REPLACEMENT in the EPG field and cannot be used to transfer content to other
  EPG fields.
- Perl-style operator 'm//' operates using backreferences similarly to when not
  using Perl-style operator but adds possibility of using modifiers.
- One or more modifiers can be appended Perl-style operators:
  - g = Global matching (only with 's///')
  - i = Case-insensitive pattern matching.
  - m = Treat string as multiple lines.
  - s = Dot matches newlines.
  - u = Handles UTF8 characters.
  - x = Ignore white spaces. Comments in regular expression using (?#comment). 
  - X = Strict escape parsing.
- Several regular expressions may be applied to same field.

Syntax of charset.conf line is "Channel_list:BroadcastCharset=OriginalCharSet"
with:
- OriginalCharSet and BroadcastCharset are names of a character set
  (e.g. iso8859-1).
- OriginalCharSet is the real character set of EPG data.
- BroadcastCharset is the optional incorrect character set received in data
  stream.
- If no BroadcastCharset is defined ISO6937 is assumed.

Syntax of blacklist.conf line is "Channel_list" with:
- Only comma separated list of channel to be ignored.

Syntax of epgclone.conf line is "FromChannel=ToChannel" with:
- Copy EPG data of FromChannel into ToChannel.
