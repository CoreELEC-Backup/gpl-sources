  cable (C), select your provider; if using satellite (S), the orbital
  position of the satellite your dish is pointing towards; or if using
  IPTV, enter the URL to your playlist.
* If you're unsure as to which list(s) to select you may want to look
  online for details about the various television reception choices
  available in your area.
