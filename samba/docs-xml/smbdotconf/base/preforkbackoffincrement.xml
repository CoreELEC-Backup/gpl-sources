	<para>This option specifies the number of seconds added to the delay
		before a prefork master or worker process is restarted.  The
		restart is initially zero, the prefork backoff increment is
		added to the delay on each restart up to the value specified by
		"prefork maximum backoff".
	</para>

	<para>Additionally the the backoff for an individual service by using
		"prefork backoff increment: service name"
		i.e. "prefork backoff increment:ldap = 2" to set the
		backoff increment to 2.</para>

	<para>If the backoff increment is 2 and the maximum backoff is 5.
		There will be a zero second delay for the first restart. A two
		second delay for the second restart. A four second delay for the
		third and any subsequent restarts</para>
