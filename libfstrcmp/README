NAME
       fstrcmp - fuzzy string compare library

DESCRIPTION
       The fstrcmp package provides a library which may be used to make fuzzy
       comparisons of strings and byte arrays.  It also provides simple
       commands for use in shell scripts.

   License
       The library is licensed under the GNU GPL.  The code is derived from
       the fuzzy comparisons functions in GNU Gettext, which is GNU GPL
       licensed.  The GNU Gettext fuzzy comparisons functions were, in turn,
       derived from GNU Diff, which is also GNU GPL licensed.

       These license details are important, because only GPL licensed
       programs, or compatibly licensed programs, may link against this
       library.
