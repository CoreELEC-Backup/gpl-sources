 * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *
 *                                                                         *
 * o Reads or includes copyrighted data files, such as Nmap's nmap-os-db   *
 * or nmap-service-probes.                                                 *

 * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *
 * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *
 * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *
 *                                                                         *
 * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *
 * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *
 * Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form does not        *
 * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *
 * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *
 * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *
 * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *
 * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *
 * Internet).                                                              *

 * o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  *
 *                                                                         *
 * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *
 * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *
 * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *
 * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *
 * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *
 * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *
 * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *
 *                                                                         *
 * As another special exception to the GPL terms, the Nmap Project grants  *
 * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *
 * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *
 * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *
 * linked combinations including the two.                                  *
 *                                                                         *
 * The Nmap Project has permission to redistribute Npcap, a packet         *
 * capturing driver and library for the Microsoft Windows platform.        *
 * Npcap is a separate work with it's own license rather than this Nmap    *
 * license.  Since the Npcap license does not permit redistribution        *
 * without special permission, our Nmap Windows binary packages which      *
 * contain Npcap may not be redistributed without special permission.      *
 *                                                                         *
 * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *
 * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *
 * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *
 * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *
 * allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as    *
 * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *
 *                                                                         *
 * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *
 * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *
 * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *
 * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *
 * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *
 * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *
 * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *
 * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *
 * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *
 *                                                                         *
 * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *
 * Nmap in other works, we are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also *
 * offer an alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary         *
 * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *
 * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *
 * as providing support and updates.  They also fund the continued         *
 * development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further           *
 * information.                                                            *
 *                                                                         *
 * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *
 * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *
 * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *
 *                                                                         *
 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *
 * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *
 * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.          *
 *                                                                         *
 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *
 * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *
 * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *
 * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *
 * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *
 * source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify            *
 * otherwise) that you are offering the Nmap Project the unlimited,        *
 * non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap     *
 * will always be available Open Source, but this is important because     *
 * the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for     *
 * other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also           *
 * occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.    *
 * If you wish to specify special license conditions of your               *
 * contributions, just say so when you send them.                          *
 *                                                                         *

/* Convert a string like "-100,n*tp,200-1024,3000-4000,[60000-]" into an array
 * of port numbers. Note that one trailing comma is OK -- this is actually
 * useful for machine generated lists
 *
 * Fyodor - Wrote original
 * William McVey - Added T:, U:, P: directives
 * Doug Hoyte - Added [], name lookups, and wildcard expansion
 *
 * getpts() handles []
 * Any port ranges included inside square brackets will have all
 * their ports looked up in nmap-services or nmap-protocols
 * and will only be included if they are found.
 * Returns a scan_list* with all the ports that should be scanned.
 *
 * getpts() handles service/protocol name lookups and wildcard expansion.
 * The service name can be specified instead of the port number.
 * For example, "ssh" can be used instead of "22". You can use wildcards
 * like "*" and "?". See the function wildtest() for the exact details.
 * For example,
 *
 * nmap -p http* host
 *
 * Will scan http (80), http-mgmt (280), http-proxy (8080), https (443), etc.
 *
 * Matching is case INsensitive but the first character in a match MUST
 * be lowercase so it doesn't conflict with the T:, U:, and P: directives.
 *
 * getpts() is unable to match service names that start with a digit
 * like 3com-tsmux (106/udp). Use a pattern like "?com-*" instead.
 *
 * BE CAREFUL ABOUT SHELL EXPANSIONS!!!
 * If you are trying to match the services nmsp (537/tcp) and nms (1429/tcp)
 * and you execute the command
 *
 * ./nmap -p nm* host
 *
 * You will see
 *
 * Found no matches for the service mask 'nmap' and your specified protocols
 * QUITTING!
 *
 * This is because nm* was expanded to the name of the binary file nmap in
 * the current directory by your shell. When unsure, quote your port strings
 * to be safe:
 *
 * ./nmap -p 'nm*' host
 *
 * getpts() is smart enough to keep the T: U: and P: directives nested
 * and working in a logical manner. For instance,
 *
 * nmap -sTU -p [U:1025-],1-1024 host
 *
 * Will scan UDP ports 1025 and up that are found in the service file
 * and all TCP/UDP ports below <= 1024. Notice that the U doesn't affect
 * the outer part of the port expression. It's "closed".
