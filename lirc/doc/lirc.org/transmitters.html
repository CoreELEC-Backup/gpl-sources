                  The following text was taken from the
                  <A
                    HREF="http://www.metzlerbros.de/lirc/index.html">
                    lirc-0.3.6</A> package with kind permission of its
                    author, Ralph Metzler. I have just substituted the
                    ASCII arts by nicer GIFs (thanks to David Norris),
                    recommend another IR LED (the LED recommended
                    originally was transmitting at 880 nm which is not
                    suitable for remote control applications which use
                    950 nm) and added a small signal diode to protect
                    the IR LED from the voltage of the serial
                    port. Most IR LEDs have reverse voltage ratings of
                    only 5V. I received reports that the range of the
                    first circuit will be much smaller if you use it
                    together with an receiver. Sometimes it will even
                    stop working at all.

                  If you are looking for a circuit with better range
                  and don't want to use an external power supply you
                  should have a look at <A

                    circuit </A> that he <A

                  myself but it looks very promising.

Simple transmitter circuit on serial port:
                </P>

R should be greater than 1K so that the current is less than 10mA (my serial
port has about +/- 10V). I guess it is also save to leave out the resistor
since the serial port should also have a max. short circuit current.
Since the maximum current is so small almost any infra-red LED should be
usable
                </P>
                <P>
The range of this device is up to 1m depending on the
receiving device (e.g. with my Sony VCR) and if you aim right at the IR
detector. Not good enough to be practical but enough to e.g. invent your own
code to control your computer and program a programmable remote with it.
                </P>
                <P>
Usage of the this circuit is not recommended if you value your serial port.
If it is on the motherboard I would not use it!
I use a serial port on a cheap serial card for testing.
Actually I only say this, so that it's not my fault if your house burns
down ...
Does anybody know what can happen if you short circuit the serial port?
                </P>
                <P>
If you don't want strain your serial port, use a bigger resistor or a simple
amplifier circuit like this:
                </P>

                <P>
R in the amplifier circuit can be chosen as small as 5 Ohm (for 5V !).
Since the signal is pulsed and with a 40kHz carrier frequency, an
LED like the LD&nbsp;271 (or others with max. 100 mA) can tolerate 1A for
a short period of time.
Some data sheets might mention how high the current can go for certain
pulse lenghts.
                </P>
                <P>
But take care that after the signal is sent the signal line is low or
your LED might become a little "brownish" like one of mine did :-)
(It even still works, but the range decreased to a few centimeters ...)
It should be safe if you use >50 (>90) Ohm for 5 (9) V, but the range
will be much smaller.
                </P>

                  Petteri Aimonen sent in the following suggestion to
                  better protect the curcuit from overloading without
                  significant loss of range. The trick is to add a
                  100nF - 220nF capacitor in parallel to the current
                  limiting resistor which he suggests can be then as
                  high as 50 Ohm:

                  Another suggestion for a <a href="http://iguanaworks.net/ir/">
                    high-power LIRC transmitter/receiver</a> comes from
                  Brian Shucker. This design integrates both receiver
                  and transmitter in one circuit using one power supply
                  just ready to use.
