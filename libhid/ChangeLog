libhid ChangeLog
================

2007-04-25 Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Preparation for the 0.2.16 release:
  - Added a number of files to the tarball [334], [336]
  - Updated documentation [331], [335], [337]
  - Fixed some autoconf macros [332], [333]

2007-04-01 Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Reworked a lot of the autoconf/automake code with regards to SWIG. This
    allows 'make distcheck' to build the Python bindings, and it improves
    detection of the paths for SWIG and Python.  SWIG is no longer necessary
    unless you want the Python bindings. [328]
  - A little bit of cleanup in swig/Makefile.am, and now 'make distcheck'
    finishes without any errors. [329]

2007-03-31 Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Moved CFLAGS into AM_CFLAGS in each directory's Makefile.am so that 'make
    distcheck' will work.
  - Temporarily removed ccache/distcc because they don't recognize when they
    are called via links. [320]
  - Updated copyright on some Makefile.am files.
  - Updated some properties on configure.ac

2007-03-30 Albert Lee (trisk+alioth@acm.jhu.edu)
  - Remove internal copy of usb_dev_handle so that libhid builds with Solaris'
    libusb. [319]

2007-02-28  Martin F. Krafft (libhid@pobox.madduck.net)
  - Remove limitation for non-zero product IDs. Thanks Shahrouz Zolfaghari.
  - Add additional docbook location.  [318]

2007-02-27  Andreas Klöckner (lists@informa.tiker.net)
  - Various SWIG patches, including a more Pythonic libhid wrapper, and
    support for hid_strerror(). [304-314]
  - Other build system fixes. [312], [315]

2006-09-28  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Added hid_strerror() for decoding return codes. [301]

2006-03-25  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Added SWIG bindings for get/set feature report functions [298]

2006-03-13  Frédéric Leroy (fredo@starox.org)
  - added 2 functions in order to use feature item :
    hid_get_feature_report() and hid_set_feature_report() [296]

2006-01-26  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - More SWIG fixes; namely, hid_interrupt_read() and hid_get_input_report().
    [288],[291]
  - Uncommented hid_get_item_value() in hid.h [291]

2006-01-22  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Merged in SWIG changes to make the Python bindings more useful.  This
    commit also had a few extra changes to some support programs and scripts,
    but those changes were not of great consequence. [284]

2005-12-31  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Added check for return values in hid_open() and hid_force_open() to catch
    the case where the interface is claimed, but the report descriptor cannot
    be retrieved. [276]

2005-09-02  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Added hid_interrupt_write() and hid_set_idle() functions. [256]
  - Added usb_strerror() calls to most of the hid_exchange functions to aid in
    debugging. [256]
  - Fixed dependencies on SWIG bindings [255]
  - Patched hidparser with fix applied to NUT (affects APC UPSes) [254]
  - Misc changes to extract_report_descriptor [251],[253]

2005-07-07  Charles Lepple (clepple+libhid@ghz.cc)
  - Removed hardcoded reference to Python 2.3 and /usr/include. Pointed out by
    Martin Dengler, and patch suggested by Martin Krafft. SVN changeset: [244]
  - Fixed "sed lstat" error when compiling with distcc on OS X. [245]
  - Mark last parameter in hid_os_force_claim() as unused. [246], [247]

2005-04-26  Martin F. Krafft (libhid@pobox.madduck.net)
  - Fixed a bug in hid_exchange.c, which would prevent input record reading.
    Thanks to Benson Wang <chungyehwang@gmail.com> for pointing this out.
  - Added a new docbook.xsl path thanks to Martin Dengler
    <phidgets@xades.com>.

2005-04-19  Martin F. Krafft (libhid@pobox.madduck.net)
  - Fixed a bug in hid_preparation.c, which hardcoded the HID USB interface to
    0. Thanks to Benson Wang <chungyehwang@gmail.com> for pointing this out.

2005-04-11  Eoin Verling <everling@snet.wit.ie>
  - Implemented hid_interrupt_read, a wrapper of usb_interrupt_read.

2005-02-25  Martin F. Krafft (libhid@pobox.madduck.net)

    Godby. Thanks, Kevin!
