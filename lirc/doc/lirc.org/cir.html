                    <p>
                      A common CIR receiver chip includes more than a
                      simple infrared photo-transistor (usually at
                      950nm). It includes demodulation circuitry
                      around a specific carrier frequency (typically
                      38kHz) and a latch circuit for its data output
                      pin that is triggered by that frequency
                      demodulation. The extra circuitry is included to
                      help block out ambient light and noise to make
                      the incoming signal more reliable. When a button
                      is pressed, the IR LED in a remote control turns
                      on and off in specific timing patterns to
                      transmit the button press data to the
                      receiver. The "on times" aren't really fully on
                      but rapidly turned on and off at the carrier
                      frequency (38kHz modulation in this example). If
                      the IR LED "on times" were fully on (like
                      looking at a flash light), the receiver chip
                      would think this was ambient light and ignore
                      it.  Since the "on times" are rapidly
                      fluctuating (modulated) at 38kHz, the receiver
                      chip's demodulation circuit triggers the latch
                      circuit and it triggers the data pin. When the
                      38kHz modulated IR light turns off (the button
                      on the IR remote control is released), the
                      receiver chip's demodulation circuit releases
                      the latch circuit and it releases the data pin.

                    <p>
                      To make things a little more complicated for
                      hardware building and software programming, the
                      CIR receiver chip's latch circuit doesn't
                      respond immediately to any changes. This is done
                      intentionally to help avoid noise problems and
                      increase signal reliability. Most receiver
                      chips' latch circuits won't activate the data
                      pin until about a dozen pulses at the carrier
                      frequency are received. When the IR carrier
                      frequency is stopped, the receiver chip's latch
                      circuit will also hold the data pin active for
                      several to a dozen more pulses in length. This
                      helps make up for the initial delay and will not
                      give spurious data signals if a few pulses of
                      the carrier frequency are missed by the
                      demodulation circuit. The latch circuit working
                      this way makes for clean data pulses on output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The latch circuit delays will cause problems for
                      critical timing applications. If the IR carrier
                      burst is too short (under 12 cycles at 38kHz in
                      this example), the latch circuit will likely not
                      trigger its data pin. If the application expects
                      short signals off the data pin, the latch
                      circuit may hold the data pin for too long and
                      cause a timing error again. If the latch circuit
                      does not release in time for a short space and
                      another IR carrier burst comes in, the output
                      data pin will be held high for the entire time
                      and make those two IR carrier bursts look like
                      one. Different receiver chips (even of the same
                      model) also have differently timed lengths for
                      their latch circuits and may cause slight
                      variations in the data pin time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The specific demodulation circuitry in the CIR
                      receiver chip doesn't mean that it will only see
                      one carrier frequency. It will likely respond to
                      10-20% higher or lower than the primary carrier
                      frequency (38kHz in this example), but the
                      physical distance of that response will decrease
                      as the frequency shifts away. Frequencies that
                      are more off will mean that the data pin latch
                      is less likely to be triggered by the
                      demodulator. This is why it is important to keep
                      application frequencies properly matched between
                      hardware.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      IR LED transmitters usually don't have frequency
                      problems since they are such simple and rapidly
                      responding devices. The transmitters also do not
                      have to decode data from a potentially unknown
                      and unreliable source like the receivers do. So
                      long as the transmitting hardware is properly
                      clocked and has all its data ready to go, it's
                      hard to screw up a transmitter. For all the
                      reasons given so far, this is why some IR
                      hardware can transmit a short burst protocol but
                      not receive it (the receiver has to be rated for
                      the short burst protocol).
