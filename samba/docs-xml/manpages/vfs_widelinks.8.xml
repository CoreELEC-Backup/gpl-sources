	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>

	<para>This VFS module is part of the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> suite.</para>

	<para>The <command>vfs_widelinks</command> VFS module
	hides the existence of symbolic links in the filesystem
	inside a share. It is used in Samba verson 4.13 and above
	to implement the <filename>smb.conf</filename>"wide links = yes"
	functionality that used to be inside the core smbd code.
	The module should not be loaded explicitly by smb.conf
	as part of the "vfs objects =" parameter, but is loaded
	implicitly when "wide links = yes" is enabled. This is
	to prevent existing smb.conf files from having to be
	modified to keep the existing insecure "wide links"
	functionality on a share.
	</para>
	<para>Please note that "wide links = yes" functionality
	is a deliberately insecure option, and should never be
	used in Samba installations. On Linux, bind mounts can
	be used instead to implement anything "wide links = yes"
	can enable. This module has been created to provide
	backwards compatibility with existing users of
	"wide links = yes" installations, but this use cannot be
	recommended and is not endorsed by the Samba developers.
	</para>
	<para>Note that this implicit loading may become explicit
	in a later Samba release, and administrators wishing to
	keep the insecure "wide links" functionality may have
	to add this module into their "vfs objects =" module
	list. The Samba project release notes and this manpage
	will be updated to reflect this when this change is made.
	</para>

	<para>This module is stackable.</para>

	<para>The original Samba software and related utilities

	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.</para>
