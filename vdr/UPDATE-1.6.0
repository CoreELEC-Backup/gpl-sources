This is a summary of the changes in VDR 1.6.0 since the last stable
version 1.4.7. It only contains things that are of actual importance
to the user and doesn't mention the many fixes and improvements that
have been made "behind the scenes".

See the file HISTORY for a detailed list of all changes.

Subtitles:

- Implemented handling DVB subtitles.
- The new setup option "DVB/Subtitle languages" can be used to define the
  preferred languages for subtitles.
- The new setup option "DVB/Subtitle offset" can be used to shift the location
  of the subtitles in the vertical direction.
- The new setup options "DVB/Subtitle foreground/background transparency"
  define an additional level of transparency for the foreground and background
  color of subtitles.

UTF-8 support:

- VDR now fully supports UTF-8.
- The actual character encoding on a given system will be determined from the
  environment. On a system that uses, for instance, ISO8859-1, VDR will encode
  everything in that code (as far as possible).

Plugins:

- The new remote control key "Subtitles" can be used to bring up the list
  of available subtitles.
- Plugins can now implement the new function WakeupTime() to request VDR to wake
  up at a particular time.

Remote control:

- The "Play" key now starts replay of the selected recording in the Recordings
  menu
- The kInfo key is now propagated to any open menu, so that it can react to it
  in a context sensitive manner. If there is no menu open it will show the info
  of the current broadcast or replay.

OSD:

- The OSD now uses Freetype fonts.
- If the OSD device in use has at least 8bpp bitmap depth and this is also
  used by the current skin, Freetype fonts are displayed "anti-aliased".
  The new setup parameter "OSD/Anti-alias" can be used to turn this off.
- Changed the parameter "OSD font" to "Default font" in "Setup/OSD".
- There can now be more than one OSD at the same time. At any given time,
  however, only one of them can be active (and thus visible). This is to
  allow displaying things like subtitles in an easy way. A cOsd therefore
  now has a "Level", and only the OSD with the smallest level will be
  displayed. The level 0 OSD is special, and there can only be one with
  this level. If there is more than one OSD with a particular level, only
  the one that was created first will be displayed.
  Plugins that provide an OSD need to adjust their cOsdProvider::CreateOsd()
  function to hand through the Level.
- Skins can now have scrollbars in all list menus.

Channels:

- The new Setup parameter "Channel entry timeout" can be used to customize the time
  since the last keypress until a numerically entered channel number is considered
  complete, and the channel is switched (suggested by Helmut Auer). Setting this
  parameter to 0 turns off the automatic channel switching, and the user will
  have to confirm the entry by pressing the "Ok" key.

Recordings:

- The info.vdr file now also stores the name of the channel.
- When deleting the recording that is currently replayed, the replay is now
  stopped immediately.
- When determining the amount of free disk space, any deleted (but not yet removed)
  recordings on different file systems (that are mounted under the video directory)
  are no longer taken into account.
- When running out of disk space during a recording, only such deleted or old
  recordings are removed, that actually are on the video directory file system(s).
  This prevents VDR from accidentally deleting recordings on other file systems,
  which would not add any free space to the video directory.

SVDRP:

- The new SVDRP command REMO can be used to turn VDR's remote control off and
  on in case other programs need to be controlled.
- Improved performance of the SVDRP commands LSTC and CHAN when used with a
  channel name.
- The SVDRP command LSTC can now list the channels with group separators if the
  option ':groups' is given.
- Enhanced the SVDRP command CLRE to allow clearing the EPG data of a particular
  channel.

Conditional Access:

- It is now automatically detected which CAM can actually decrypt a channel.
- CAMs can now be dynamically assigned to the various devices, provided the
  hardware in use implements such a possibility.
- Improved handling of the CAM menu.
- Several encrypted channels on the same transponder can now be decrypted
  simultaneously with one CAM, if the CAM supports this.
- Ca values in the range 0...F in channels.conf can still be used to assign a channel
  to a particular device, but this will no longer work with encrypted channels because
  without valid CA ids VDR can't decide which CAM slot to use. However, since VDR now
  automatically determines which CAM can decrypt which channel, setting fixed
  channel/device relations should no longer be necessary.
  IF AN ENCRYPTED CHANNEL CAN'T BE DECRYPTED AND YOU HAVE A CA VALUE IN THE RANGE
  0...F FOR THAT CHANNEL, SET IT TO 0 (FTA) AND TUNE TO THE CHANNEL AGAIN.
- Removed switching to the next higher or lower channel if the current channel
  is not available, in order to allow staying on an encrypted channel that takes
  a while for the CAM to start decrypting.

Internationalization:

- Internationalization is now done with 'gettext'.
  See README.i18n for information on how to create new or maintain existing
  translations.
- The parameter OSDLanguage in 'setup.conf' is now a string and holds the locale
  code of the selected OSD language (e.g. en_US). If Setup.OSDLanguage is not
  set to a particular locale that is found in VDR's locale directory, the
  locale as defined in the system environment is used by default.
- The new option --localedir can be used to set the locale directory at runtime.
- Added Turkish language texts.
- Added Ukrainian language texts.
- Added Chinese language texts.

Misc:

- Improved shutdown handling.
- The HUP signal now forces a restart of VDR.
- All logging now goes to LOG_ERR, because some systems split error, info and
  debug messages into separate files, which repeatedly caused extra efforts to
  find out when incomplete log excerpts were attached to problem reports in
  the past.
- The new setup option "Miscellaneous/Emergency exit" can be used to turn off
  the automatic restart of VDR in case a recording fails for some reason.
- The new plugin "pictures" implements a simple picture viewer.
  See PLUGINS/src/pictures/README for details.
- Added the new command line option --userdump to enable core dumps in case VDR
  is run as root with option -u.
- The free disk space is now also displayed in the title of the "Recordings"
  menu.
- Changed the message "Upcoming VPS recording!" to "Upcoming recording!" because
  it applies to non-VPS recordings as well.
- Limiting the length of the recording name in timers in case VDR is run with
  --vfat, in order to avoid names that are too long for Windows.
