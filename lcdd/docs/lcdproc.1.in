.SH NAME
lcdproc - system status information client

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lcdproc
[\fB\-hfv\fP]
[\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\fP]
[\fB\-s\fP \fIhost\fP]
[\fB\-p\fP \fIport\fP]

[\fIscreen\fP ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlcdproc\fP is the client in the LCDproc suite that displays information about the local
system's status on an LCD that is connected to an LCDd server daemon.
.PP
Due to the client-server architecture it does not matter whether the LCDd daemon runs
on the local machine or on a remote system.
.PP
Most settings of \fBlcdproc\fP are configured through its configuration file
\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/lcdproc.conf\fP, some of them can be overridden using command line options.
.PP
Before running \fBlcdproc\fP you should carefully read through that file and modify
the settings therein according to your needs.
.PP
When compiled appropriately, some aspects of \fBlcdproc\fP can even configured
at run time using a menu on the LCD.
.PP
Currently, only Linux, the BSD variants FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Darwin as well as Solaris
are supported, but not all features may be available on all platforms.

.SH OPTIONS
.B lcdproc
understands these command line options:
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig\fP
Use a configuration file other than @SYSCONFDIR@/LCDd.conf
.TP
.B \-s \fIhost\fP
Connect to the LCDd server on \fIhost\fP, instead to the one listed
in te \fBServer\fP parameter in the config file's \fB[lcdproc]\fP section.
If not given here and not specified in the config file or if the default config file
does not exist, it defaults to '\fIlocalhost\fP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fP
Use port \fIport\fP when connecting to the LCDd server on \fIhost\fP.
This option overrides the \fBPort\fP parameter in the config file's \fB[lcdproc]\fP section.
Without a default config file or when not set in the config file,
it defaults to the LCDproc port \fI13666\fP.
.TP
.B \-f
Run in the foreground, overriding the \fBForeground\fP parameter
in the config file's \fB[lcdproc]\fP section.
The default, if not in the config file or without a config file, is to
daemonize \fBlcdproc\fP as it is intended to display the system information
in the background.
.TP
.B \-e \fIdelay\fP
Sleep \fIdelay\fP in 100ths of seconds between updating screens in an update cycle.
This option overrides the \fBDelay\fP parameter in the config file's \fB[lcdproc]\fP section.
When not given and not in the config file, it defaults to 0.
.TP
.B \-h
Show help screen.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version of \fBlcdproc\fP and exit.
.TP
.B \fIscreen\fP
can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP 16
.B C CPU
show detailed CPU usage
.TP 16
.B P SMP-CPU

.TP 16
.B G CPUGraph

.B M Memory

.TP 16
.B O OldTime

.PP
On the command line you may either use the short or the long \fIscreen\fP name.
In the config file, the long names are used as section labels to configure the screens
further.
.PP
You may also prefix the screen names with an exclamation mark '\fB!\fP' to disable
a screen that was activated in the config file instead of activating a disabled one.

.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
.I lcdproc C M D '!L'
.RE
.PP
With the command line specified above, \fBlcdproc\fP loads the default configuration file,
connects to the LCDd server specified therein and then displays the following screens
in addition to those activated in the configuration file on the LCD:
.IP *
detailed CPU Usage
.IP *
Memory & swap usage
.IP *
filling level of the mounted file systems
.PP
The
.IP *
Load histogram
.PP
screen is disabled and therefore not shown in the display.
(The quotes are not part of lcdproc's command line syntax;
they are required to disable special interpretation of the exclamation mark by the shell).

.SH LEGAL STUFF
LCDproc is released as "WorksForMe-Ware".
In other words, it is free, kinda neat, and we don't guarantee that it will do
anything in particular on any machine except the ones it was developed on.
.PP
It is technically released under the GNU GPL license (you should have received the file,
"COPYING", with LCDproc) (also, look on http://www.fsf.org/ for more information),
so you can distribute and use it for free -- but you must make the source code freely
available to anyone who wants it.
.PP
For any sort of real legal information, read the GNU GPL (GNU General Public License).
It's worth reading.
