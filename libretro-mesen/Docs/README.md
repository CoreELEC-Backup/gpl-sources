This is the source code/resources used to build the documentation website located at [https://www.mesen.ca/docs/](https://www.mesen.ca/docs/)

It requires hugo to build.  You can download  hugo here: [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/).

Use the "build.cmd" batch file to build a copy of the documentation - it will be saved to the "docs" subfolder.
