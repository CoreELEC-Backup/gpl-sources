.SH NOTES

To replace PVs, \fBvgdisplay --partial --verbose\fP will show the
UUIDs and sizes of any PVs that are no longer present. If a PV in the VG
is lost and you wish to substitute another of the same size, use
\fBpvcreate --restorefile filename --uuid uuid\fP (plus additional
arguments as appropriate) to initialise it with the same UUID as the
missing PV. Repeat for all other missing PVs in the VG.  Then use
\fBvgcfgrestore --file filename\fP to restore the VG's metadata.
