=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchmenu.conf> - Customizing the EPG menus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file F<epgsearchmenu.conf> in your epgsearch config directory is used to store
the entries for customizing the EPG menus. You specify the look of each menu
(What's on now, What's on next, What's on at ..., Schedule, Search results,
Favorites) with a separate line.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 MenuWhatsOnNow=%chnr%:3|%progrt2s%:5| %time% %t_status%:8|%category%:6| %title% ~ %subtitle%:35
 MenuWhatsOnNext=%chnr%:3|%time% %t_status%:8|%category%:8| %title% ~ %subtitle%:35
 MenuWhatsOnElse=%chnr%:3|%time% %t_status%:8|%category%:8| %title% ~ %subtitle%:35
 MenuSchedule=%time% %t_status%:8|%genre%:14| %title% ~ %subtitle%:35
 MenuSearchResults=%chnr%:3|%datesh% %time% %t_status%:14|%genre%:8| %title%%colon% %subtitle%:35
 MenuFavorites=%chnr%:3|%datesh% %time% %t_status%:14|%genre%:8| %title%%colon%%subtitle%:35

=head1 SYNTAX

E.g. the entry 'MenuWhatsOnNow' tells epgsearch how you would like to build a
line for the menu 'What's on now'. This would create a menu line starting with
the channel number, followed by a progress bar in text2skin style, a space of
one char, the start time, the timer status, the EPG category (like "movie")
and finally the title and subtitle.

The values for MenuWhatsOnNext, MenuWhatsOnElse, MenuSchedule,
MenuSearchResults, MenuFavorites specify the menu 'What's on next', 'What's on
at ...', 'Schedule', 'Search results' and 'Favorites' respectively. If you do
not specify one entry, epgsearch uses its default menu look.

'MenuSearchResults' has something special: If you want to have different
layouts for your search results depending on the search, you can use more then
one menu template. Simply define e.g. an additional

 MenuSearchResultsTip of the Day=%chnr%:3|%time_w%:4|%t_status%:3|%genre%:10|%title%%colon% %subtitle%:35

This will produce an additional menu item "Result menu layout" in the edit
menu of a search where you can choose between the default menu template and your
own templates. In the example above you will get "Tip of the Day" as selection
entry, since epgsearch simply cuts the leading "MenuSearchResults". When you
display the search results the chosen template will be used instead of the
default one.

The following variables exist:

 %time%           - start time in format HH:MM
 %date%           - start date in format TT.MM.YY
 %datesh%         - start date in format TT.MM.
 %time_w%         - weekday name
 %time_d%         - start day in format TT
 %time_lng%       - start time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00
 %title%          - title
 %subtitle%       - subtitle
 %t_status%       - timer status ('T', 't', 'R')
 %v_status%       - VPS status
 %r_status%       - running status
 %status%         - complete status, the same as
                    '%t_status%%v_status%%r_status%'
 %colon%          - the sign ':'
 %<epg-category>% - a value from the extended EPG categories, specified in
                    epgsearchcats.conf, like %genre% or %category%

for the 'Whats on...' and 'Search results' menu there is also:

 %chnr%           - channel number
 %chsh%           - the short channel name
 %chlng%          - the 'normal' channel name
 %chdata%         - VDR's internal channel representation (e.g. 'S19.2E-1-1101-28106')
 %progr%          - graphical progress bar (not for menu 'Search results')
 %progrT2S%       - progress bar in text2skin style (not for menu 'Search results')

the variables are not case sensitive.

An entry consists of up to 6 tables separated with '|'. The last entry of
each table should declare the table width in chars, separated with ':'.

If you use a separator like '~', '-' or '#' to separate items like title or
subtitle, e.g. %title% ~ %subtitle%, and the subtitle is empty, then epgsearch
will try to fix this automatically to avoid a trailing separator.

You should vary the tab width values to fit your needs, since the look often
depends on the selected skin. epgsearchmenu.conf is not reloaded with every
plugin call, since this is only useful when testing the conf file. To activate
the permanent reload for testing your conf, pass the new start parameter '-r'
or '--reloadmenuconf' in your runvdr.

There's a sample F<epgsearchmenu.conf> in the subdirectory "conf". For a quick try
copy it to your epgsearch config directory (e.g. /etc/vdr/plugins/epgsearch).

To enable icons from the VDRSymbols font simply put the line

 WarEagleIcons=1

to F<epgsearchmenu.conf>. The VDRSymbols font is available at
+http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/fonts/download.html

NOTE: As long as there is a file epgsearchmenu.conf with an entry for a special
menu, all setup settings regarding the look of this menu are ignored.
