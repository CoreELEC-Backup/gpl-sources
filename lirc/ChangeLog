2017-08-14  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	build: install media/lirc.h (BTS #872074).
	The plugin builds references this file. Basically, this should be
	resolved by lirc_driver.h, testing if the kernel header is
	available and using it if so, but without including config.h

	This fix adds an evil symlink to not remove anything. The proper
	fix includes actually moving the file and also streamlining the
	HAVE_KERNEL_LIRC_H to the generic HAVE_LINUX_LIRC_H.

	lib/curl_poll.h: fix header guard collision with musl libc
	The musl libc uses the _POLL_H macro as a double include guard for the poll.h
	header. This breaks compilation of files the include curl_poll.h:

	In file included from driver.h:32:0,
	                 from driver.c:12:
	lirc/curl_poll.h:38:29: error: array type has incomplete element type ‘struct pollfd’
	 int curl_poll(struct pollfd ufds[], unsigned int nfds, int timeout_ms);
	                             ^~~~

	Rename the curl_poll.h header guard macro to avoid collision. Don't use a name
	that starts with an underscore and a capital letter since these names are
	reserved according to the ANSI C standard.

2017-05-14  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	Use lircd waitfordata() instead of copy in lib/receive (#278).
	Using a separate waitfordata() in lib/receive causes subtle errors
	when transmitting if data is received concurrently. In all
	circumstances, having two parallel poll()/select() loops is a
	bad idea leading to hard-to-understand logics.

	Patch lets clients such as lircd set the function used by
	waitfordata() in lib/receive, effectively forcing drivers to
	used the lircd waitfordata() function. This centralizes the
	event loop to a single function.

	lib/receive still uses the old function as default e. g., when
	used by irrecord.

	Old and new python code now lives in  python-pkg/. This is installed

	pypi package which could be installed e. g., in a virtualenv.

	The API contains pieces to send commands and receive data. See the
	API docs and also the manual. It is supposed to be complete in the
	sense that it can handle all known socket commands to lircd(0) and
	lircrcd(8). It can also receive both raw events like irw(1) and
	application string like ircat(1).

	There are also some proof-of-concepts in doc/python-bindings. If
	installed in a virtualenc the pypi package installs the lirctool
	script, a more complete demonstration of the API.

	build: Fix python3 command handling
	The old--enable-python3-fix was a abomination, installing a

	The bug occurs on Ubuntu, where some build hosts seems to lack
	this device. It will also bite anyone doing a traditional
	cross-compilation. The new option should work in all cases, not
	adding so much  complexity since the default is almost always
	sane.

	ftdi: Fix retry logic

	* Open failing
	* Unplugging and replugging the ftdi device

	ftdi: Refactor to clarify looping logic
	Previously this function was confusing because the loop/retry condition

	lib: use proper linking method to avoid parallel build issue
	Using <foo>_LDFLAGS = -l<library> is correct when <library> is an
	external library. However, when it is built by the same package, and
	especially in the same directory, this is wrong and can cause parallel
	build issues. In lib/Makefile.am, there was:

	libirrecord_la_LDFLAGS      = -llirc

	But the liblirc library is built in the same directory. Or, due to the
	using of <foo>_LDFLAGS, make is not aware of the build dependency
	between libirrecord and liblirc.

	To solve this, <foo>_LIBADD should be used instead, as follows:

	libirrecord_la_LIBADD       = liblirc.la

	This fixes parallel build issues seen by automated build tests
	conducted by the Buildroot project, such as:

	between libirrecord and liblirc.

	To solve this, <foo>_LIBADD should be used instead, as follows:

	libirrecord_la_LIBADD       = liblirc.la

	This fixes parallel build issues seen by automated build tests
	conducted by the Buildroot project, such as:

	plugins/ftdi: Specify duty_cycle to fix ftdi driver
	The recent commit c9afda9 added support for duty_cycle to the ftdi driver.
	This worked for lircd config files that actually specified `duty_cycle`
	but broke it for config files that didn't as it would default to 0 rather
	than 50.

	Before this commit it was the responsibility of each driver that implements
	duty_cycle to know about this default.  This fix centralises the defaults
	by adding a getter function to `ir_remote`, simplifying the drivers.  As a
	result, even though this patch is to fix a bug in ftdi it touches the
	default driver too.

	This issue didn't come up in testing c9afda9 because I'd only tested it
	with config files that actually explicitly set duty_cycle.

	For the ftdix driver I hard-code a duty_cycle of 50 because that's all it's
	capable of.  Passing in duty_cycle to modulate_pulses in this instance was
	misleading.

	Kudos: Dave Röthlisberg (testing).

2016-05-06  Nigel Kettlewell  <njk@stealth.njknet.org.uk>

	plugins/uirt: Don't block if a 0xff is received by usb-uirt .
	Periodically the usb§$-uirt-raw sends a short signal without any IR
	activity. I don't know what the signal is, but as it's a "raw" receiver
	I presume it's some interference.

	Regardless, the problem is that the uirt receiver code sees this short
	signal, and the main loop goes back to the uirt2 code because there is
	data remaining to be read. It reads a 0xff as the first byte in
	uirt2_read_raw and that function goes back to read more .. but there
	isn't any more, so it blocks forever because the main loop function gave
	us a timeout of zero .. which is turned into an infinite timeout in
	waitfordata.

	Subsequent IR keypresses DO work, because the blocking read gets some
	data. But subsequent connections to the socket (e.g. by irw or irsend)
	DON'T work: they block until some IR activity occurs which could be many
	minutes later, because lircd is stuck in a poll on the USB fd, but isn't
	polling on the socket connection fd, which is only done by the main
	loop.

	There may other ways to fix this, but this does work. With the patch I
	can always connect to the socket, and IR keypresses continue to be
	processed correctly.

	plugins/ftdi: Add new ftdix driver + documentation.
	Mode2 transmitter using the bitbang mode of an FTDI USB-to-serial chip such as
	the FT230X.  The standard FTDI driver with the FT232R is unreliable having a
	IR transmit failure rate of ~2%.  The FT232R also becomes unusable if you set
	the tx_baud_rate to values other than 65536.

	This driver works differently modifying its tx_baud_rate according to the
	carrier frequency set.  This is ok because the FT230X does not have the timing
	bugs present in the FT232R.  This allows much lower data rates over USB and
	so improves reliablity, particularly if other devices are connect to the same
	USB port.

	Receive is not included to significantly simplify design of this driver.

	plugins/ftdi: Conform to lirc driver API v2 lifecycle expectations
	As documented in a1c63fe.  Specifically:

	> * At some later point, lirc calls the deinit() func. This puts the
	>   driver in a stand-by state, from which it is a reasonably fast
	>   operation to call `init_func()` again.
	> * As a last operation, lirc might call the `close()` func. This
	>   relinquishes all resources allocated by the driver.
	> * functions are not guaranteed to be executed in the order described.
	>   In general, the driver should not break if e. g., the `init()` or
	>   `deinit()` function is called twice.

2016-04-26  William Manley  <will@williammanley.net>

	plugins/ftdi: Tear down subprocess if parent dies
	If the lircd parent process is killed with SIGKILL it will be unable
	to call `hwftdi_deinit` and so the subprocess it spawned will continue
	living, keeping the ftdi device busy.  This change uses receiving EOF
	on the pipe from the parent process as a signal that the parent process
	has died and will shut itself down accordingly too.

	plugins/ftdi: Add support for duty_cycle in lirc configuration file
	An IR signal is modulated on a carrier.  The carrier consists of a square
	wave of 0 and 1 at a default frequency of 38kHz.  The duty_cycle is the
	percentage of the time that the carrier is at 1 rather than at 0 during
	a carrier cycle.  It is in the range 1-99.

	plugins/ftdi: Refactor pulling pulse creation function by itself
	The new `write_pulse` function is more functional and less dependent on
	the other implementation details of the ftdi driver.  This will give me
	more oppertunity to investigate its operation.

	girs: Add device_hint, update to API version 3.

2015-09-27  Bengt Martensson  <barf@bengt-martensson.de>

	Girs driver: completed code, documented.

2015-09-24  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	irrecord: Fix insane driver default being devinput.

2015-09-22  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	Merge branch 'config'
	A bunch of fixes which eventually updates the configuration data
	database. The input is coming from several sources ending up in
	a number of yaml files in configs/. The database has a python API;
	current code is updated to use this uniform API.

	The driver api is bumped after adding configuration hooks to the
	drivers.

2015-09-22  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	contrib: Add generic USB devices permissions rule

	Documentation: updates for configuration tools.

	datatable: Adapt to new database format.

	data2hwdb: Adapt to new data model.

	lirc-setup: Handle local files, fix some deprecations.

	lirc-setup: Adapting to new data model.

	build: Add mechanics to build *yaml files.

	Adding new lirc-kerneldrivers tool.

	configs/README: Provisionary config file documentation.

	configs: Update to new standards, resurrect most in attic.
	The open question is how many configs using the 'default' driver that
	actually are supported by the kernel. The first one who actually
	tries will know, there isn't much of an alternative (?).

2015-09-22  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	configs: Nove obsolete configs to attic
	The lirc_gpio driver is retired since long. Moving configs
	depneding on this driver to new "attic" place so they can
	still be found if someone wants to resurrect them.

	The wpc8769l driver didn't make it when the lirc drivers were
	upstreamed to the kernel. Moving the config to the attic, and
	re-adding the kernel driver (which doesn't build as-is) if
	someone want's to resurrect them.

2015-09-22  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	configs: First stab on kernel-drivers.dist.

	irdb-get: Add support for creating confs_by_driver yaml.
	   - New yaml-config subcommand creates confs_by_driver.yaml
	   - Add support for XDG_CACHE_HOME for cached directory
	   - Add testing environment variables.
	   - Add -v/--version support

	lirc-lsplugins: Add support for yaml listing.

	plugins: Show real device in error feedback.
	For drivers which autodetects devices the probed the device should
	be made available as early as possible in driver.device so that
	error messages can reflect the probed device.

2015-09-21  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	plugins: Add configuration data, API version bump to 3.

	plugins: devinput: Handle larger events (kernel interface update).
	kernel input events are now 24 bytes, breaking some hard-coded
	limits in both this driver and in mode2. Bump driver interface
	version.

	NEWS: update.

2015-09-20  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	mode2: Make read buffer size dynamic.
	New input size from the /dev/input events breaks hard-coded limits.
	Instead of just raising the limits makes the size dynamic.

	plugins: devinput: Add DRVCTL_GET_RAW_CODELENGTH support.
	If mode2 should work, it needs to read the correct number of bytes
	when reading from /dev/input devices. This is required, since
	this driver does not implement readdata().

	lib: Add new DRVCTL_GET_RAW_CODELENGTH drvctl command.

	lib: Use correct groups when dropping CLI privileges.

	  Add note on bundled header in lirc(4).
	  irsend: Fix help message + manpage glitch.
	  Various bugfixes.

	Add lircd setup tool (#121).

	plugins/default: Just check lirc protocol if read-only access (#133).
	When assuring the the used protocol is 'lirc' in the current rc device,
	first check if it's already set. If OK, the code works without write
	access.

	plugins/devinput: Add an "auto" device (#134).

2015-09-18  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	Clean up documentation (#136).
	Remove the manpages under html/ and mode everything to lirc.org.

	the different view from api-docs/ and lirc.org/html.

	The symlinks can now be easily expanded using tar --dereference.

2015-09-09  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	lib: Fix missing --lirc flag.
	This is not strictly required, the linker resolves the symbols anyway.
	However, there is packaging noise without it.

	irrecord: Fix crash when invoked without arguments.

2015-09-08  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	checkfiles: Mute needless kernel.space check (#135).

	Revert "tools: Add missing file lirc-setup/database.py."
	This reverts commit 034bc3b198a057427d79d4bd93a40234936be1cc, which is
	part of a yet-not-merged feature branch.

2015-09-07  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	default: Conditionalize kernel bug walk-around
	The fix introduced in "19b01d plugins: default: Work around kernel bug
	(#119)" does not play with the regression tests.  Add a simple fix
	which disables the fix if LIRC_REGRESSION_TEST is defined in the
	environment for now, better long-term strategies are needed later,
	and update the test script.

	contrib: Update release process.

	Restore some old files to original shape.

	lirc_options.conf: Clean-up.

	lirc-config-tool: Update some heuristics.

	Updating to 0.9.4-devel

	Link a single large doc file to keep dist archives sane.
	WHile it's good thing to have everything in the archive (and versioned)
	this single seldom read PDF doubles the distribution size. Store
	it on sourceforge outside the git repo and link to it.

	gitignore

	Documentation (README, Install.txt, lirc.org/index.html) fixed.

	Build: Add configdir and plugindocs pkg-config support.
	Add configdir pkg-config variable so that plugins compiled
	out-of-tree knows where to install configuration. Likewise
	add a new plugindocs directory wheer plugins can install docs.
	Having these available using pkg-config mean that drivers
	don't need to be configured.

2015-08-16  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	lircd: Set supplementary groups (RH bz 1253907).
	Setting effective user id isn't enough, we also need the supplementary
	groups (e. g., to access /var/lock files).

	Downstream: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1253907

	This is perhaps no final solution, but definitely makes the semantics
	better.

2015-08-16  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>
