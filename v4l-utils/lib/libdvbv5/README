DVBv5 LIBRARY
=============

This is the DVBv5 API library. It is backward compatible and makes use of the
DVBv3 API if needed.

CONTENTS OF THE TREE
====================

parse_string.c/parse_string.h: MPEG-TS string decoder with charset translator

Used to decode NIT/SDT service name, network provider and provider name.
It parses the charsets according with the DVB specs, converting them into
UTF-8 (or other charset), using iconv library.

descriptors.c/descriptors.h:  MPEG-TS descriptors parser

The code there is generig enough to decode the MPEG-TS descriptors,
with the DVB and other Digital TV extensions.

libscan.c/libscan/h: DVBv5 scanning library

This library is used to retrieve DVB information from the MPEG TS
headers, discovering the services associated to each DVB channel or
transponder. The services information is the basic info that most
DVB tools need to tune into a channel.

dvb-file.c/dvb-file.h: DVB file read/write library.

Allows parsing a DVB file (legacy or not) and to write data into a
DVB file (new format only).

dvb-fe.c/dvb-fe.h: DVB frontend library.

Allows talking with a DVB frontend via DVBv5 or DVBv3 API.

dvb-zap-format.c/dvb-legacy-channel-format.c:

Contains the data structures required in order to read from the legacy
formats (zap or scan "initial-tuning-data-file").

dvb-frontend.h: DVBv5 frontend API.

This is just a copy of the newest linux/dvb/frontend.h header.
I opted to keep a copy there, in order to allow working with the tools
without needing to copy the latest header into /usr/include.

dvb-v5.h/dvb-v5-std.h:

Ancillary files linked into dvb-fe code, used to parse DVB tables. The
dvbv5.h is generated by a small perl util, from the DVB FE API file.

dvb-demux.c/dvb-demux.h: DVB demux library.

Patches are welcome!
