.SH NAME
zip2st \- a program for converting .zip archives to Atari .st disk images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zip2st
.RI srcname.zip
.RI [dstname.st]
.SH DESCRIPTION
zip2st can be used to convert a .zip file to a .st disk image.
.PP
If the destination filename is not given, use the name of the .zip
file, without the extension, and save it in the current working
directory.
.PP
Any single directories (other than 'auto') at root of the zip archive
are traversed down to avoid adding redundant intermediate directories
from the zip file to the generated disk image.
.PP
The .st disk image is a raw disk image, and can be written to a floppy
using dd(1) or converted to .msa disk image with hmsa(1).
.PP
The contents of the uncompressed zip file need to be smaller than
2.88MB (the largest floppy image size supported by Hatari).
