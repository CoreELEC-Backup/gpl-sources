This is a little channel scan utility to generate szap/tzap/czap/azap
compatible channel lists. An atsc/dvbscan does not do a frequency scan, however,
so you must manually provide the data for tuning to one or more start
transponders. Up to date initial-tuning-data files can be obtained from
linuxtv.org. Use git clone http://linuxtv.org/git/dtv-scan-tables.git or via
github https://github.com/oliv3r/dtv-scan-tables.git if you prefer so.

If you make a new one or improve uppon existing ones feel free to submit it to
the linux-dvb mailing list http://www.linuxtv.org/lists.php.

Basic usage: ./dvbscan dvb-s/Astra-19.2E | tee mychannels.conf
or           ./atscscan atsc/us-NTSC-center-frequencies-8VSB

If you want it to check a specific frequency, tune to that frequency
(e.g. using szap/tzap/czap/azap) and then use './dvbscan -c' or './atscscan -c'.

For more scan options see ./dvbscan -h or ./atscscan -h

atscscan is _just_ a copy of dvbscan to not confuse ATSC-user.

Good luck,
