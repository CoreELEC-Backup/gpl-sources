megarc(5)
=========

NAME
----
megarc - Configuration file for megatools


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'~/.megarc'
'./.megarc'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Megatools use INI configuration file to store commonly used login credentials.
This makes it less bothersome to use the tools, as you can simply write

--------
$ megadf
--------

instead of

--------
$ megadf --username my@email.com --password mypass
--------

when using the tools.

Configuration file is read either from the current directory or user's home
directory. Exceptions are when `--ignore-config-file` was passed to the tool, or
when explicit path to the config file was given via `--config <path>`.


CONFIG FILE SECTIONS
--------------------

All sections are optional. All names are case sensitive, thus you must write
[Login], and not [login], and so on.


[Login] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username::
	Your username.

Password::
	Your password. Be aware that back slashes have special meaning. If you
	have back slash in your password, you must escape it with another
	backslash. For example: my\nice\password would be written as
	my\\nice\\password in the config file.


[Cache] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeout::
	Cache timeout in seconds (default is 10 minutes).


[Network] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DownloadSpeedLimit::
	Set maximum allowed download speed in KiB/s.
	0 means no limit. Overrides SpeedLimit setting.

UploadSpeedLimit::
	Set maximum allowed upload speed in KiB/s.
	0 means no limit. Overrides SpeedLimit setting.
	When using ParallelTransfers > 1, upload speed limit is applied
	to each transfer individually.

SpeedLimit::
	Set maximum allowed upload and download speed in KiB/s.
	0 means no limit.

ParallelTransfers::
	Set maximum allowed number of parallel connections when upload or downloading a file.
	The file is split into chunks of a size between 128 kiB and 1 MiB, and these chunks
	are uploaded in parallel.
	The number must be between 1 and 16. Default is 5.

Proxy::
	Use proxy server to connect to mega.nz.
	More information can be found in libcurl documentation at

[Network]
# 1MiB/s
SpeedLimit = 1024
# Use over TOR
