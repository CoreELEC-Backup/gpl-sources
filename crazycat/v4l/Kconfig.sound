	help
	  If you want to record audio from TV cards based on
	  Brooktree Bt878/Bt879 chips, say Y here and read
	  <Documentation/sound/alsa/Bt87x.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-bt87x.

	help
	  Say Y here if 448000 Hz isn't enough for you and you want to
	  record from the analog input with up to 1792000 Hz.

	  Higher sample rates won't hurt your hardware, but audio
	  quality may suffer.

	help
	  Say Y here to include support for soundcards based on the ForteMedia
	  FM801 chip with a TEA5757 tuner connected to GPIO1-3 pins (Media
	  Forte SF256-PCS-02) into the snd-fm801 driver.

	  This will enable support for the old V4L1 API.
