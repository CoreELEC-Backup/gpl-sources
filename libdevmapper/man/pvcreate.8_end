.SH EXAMPLES

Initialize a partition and a full device.
.br
.B pvcreate /dev/sdc4 /dev/sde

If a device is a 4KiB sector drive that compensates for windows
partitioning (sector 7 is the lowest aligned logical block, the 4KiB
sectors start at LBA -1, and consequently sector 63 is aligned on a 4KiB
boundary) manually account for this when initializing for use by LVM.
.br
.B pvcreate --dataalignmentoffset 7s /dev/sdb
