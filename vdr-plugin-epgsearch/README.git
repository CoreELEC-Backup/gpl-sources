Note:
This is a dummy README needed by some maintainers that use the git
repository to fetch epgsearch. In the official or beta tar balls it
is replaced by a symbolic link to

./doc/en/epgsearch.1.txt

which is not part of the git repository since it is built from the
sources (via 'make docs').

If its in the way, just remove it.
