 Version history:
 0.8 initial version - LN
 0.9 MAME conversion, glue code added - R. Belmont
 1.0 partly fixed stream update - LN (0.111u4)
 1.01 fixed clipping problem - LN (0.111u5)
 1.1 add VSU-1000 features, fully fixed stream update by fixing word latching - LN (0.111u6)
 1.11 fix signedness of output, pre-multiply, fixes clicking on VSU-1000 volume change - LN (0.111u7)
 1.20 supports setting the clock freq directly - reset is done by external hardware,
      the chip has no reset line ZV (0.122)
 1.30 move main dac to 4 bits only with no extension (4->16 bit range extension is now done by output).
 Added a somewhat better, but still not perfect, filtering system - LN
 1.31 fix a minor bug with the dac range. wolfpack clips again, and I'm almost sure its an encoding error on the original speech - LN (0.125u9)
 1.31a Add chip pinout and other notes - LN (0.128u4)
 1.31b slight update to notes to clarify input bus stuff, mostly finish the state map in the comments - LN
 1.31c remove usage of deprecat lib - AtariAce (0.128u5)
 1.32 fix the squealing noise using a define; it isn't accurate to the chip exactly, but there are other issues which need to be fixed too. see TODO. - LN (0.136u2)

 TODO:
 * increase accuracy of internal S14001A 'filter' for both driven and undriven cycles (its not terribly inaccurate for undriven cycles, but the dc sliding of driven cycles is not emulated)
 * add option for and attach Frank P.'s emulation of the Analog external filter from the vsu-1000 using the discrete core. (with the direction of independent sound core and analog stuff, this should actually be attached in the main berzerk/frenzy driver and not here)
 * fix the local and global silence stuff to not force the dac to a specific level, but cease doing deltas (i.e. force all deltas to 0) after the last sample; this should fix the clipping in wolfpack and in the fidelity games in mess.

/* Chip Pinout:
The original datasheet (which is lost as far as I know) clearly called the
s14001a chip the 'CRC chip', or 'Custom Rom Controller', as it appears with
this name on the Stern and Canon schematics, as well as on some TSI speech
print advertisements.
Labels are not based on the labels used by the Atari wolf pack and Stern
schematics, as these are inconsistent. Atari calls the word select/speech address
input pins SAx while Stern calls them Cx. Also Atari and Canon both have the bit
ordering for the word select/speech address bus backwards, which may indicate it
was so on the original datasheet. Stern has it correct, and I've used their Cx
labeling.

                     |________________|

*Note from Kevin Horton when testing the hookup of the S14001A: the /BUSY line
is not a standard voltage line: when it is in its HIGH state (i.e. not busy) it
puts out a voltage of -10 volts, so it needs to be dropped back to a sane
voltage level before it can be passed to any sort of modern IC. The address
lines for the speech rom (A0-A11) do not have this problem, they output at a
TTL/CMOS compatible voltage. The AUDIO OUT pin also outputs a voltage below GND,
and the TEST pins may do so too.

START is pulled high when a word is to be said and the word number is on the
word select/speech address input lines. The Canon 'Canola' uses a separate 'rom
strobe' signal independent of the chip to either enable or clock the speech rom.
Its likely that they did this to be able to force the speech chip to stop talking,
which is normally impossible. The later 'version 3' TSI speech board as featured in
an advertisement in the John Cater book probably also has this feature, in addition
to external speech rom banking.

The Digital out pins supply a copy of the 4-bit waveform which also goes to the
internal DAC. They are only valid every other clock cycle. It is possible that
on 'invalid' cycles they act as a 4 bit input to drive the dac.

Because it requires -10V to operate, the chip manufacturing process must be PMOS.

/-----------\
> Operation <
\-----------/
Put the 6-bit address of the word to be said onto the C0-C5 word select/speech
address bus lines. Next, clock the START line low-high-low. As long as the START
line is held high, the first address byte of the first word will be read repeatedly
every clock, with the rom enable line enabled constantly (i.e. it doesn't toggle on
and off as it normally does during speech). Once START has gone low-high-low, the
/BUSY line will go low until 3 clocks after the chip is done speaking.

/* state map:

 * state machine 1: odd/even clock state
 * on even clocks, audio output is floating, /romen is low so rom data bus is driven, input is latched?
 * on odd clocks, audio output is driven, /romen is high, state machine 2 is clocked
 * *****
 * state machine 2: decoder state
 * NOTE: holding the start line high forces the state machine 2 state to go to or remain in state 1!
 * state 0(Idle): Idle (no sample rom bus activity, output at 0), next state is 0(Idle)

 * state 1(GetHiWord):
 *   grab byte at (wordinput<<1) -> register_WH

 *   load the length counter with the bits 'S S S 0'
 *   NOTE: though only three bits of the length counter load value are controllable, there is a fourth lower bit which is assumed 0 on start and controls the direction of playback, i.e. forwards or backwards within a phone.
 *   NOTE: though only two bits of the repeat counter reload value are controllable, there is a third bit which is loaded to 0 on phoneme start, and this hidden low-order bit of the counter itself is what controls whether the output is forced to silence in mirrored mode. the 'carry' from the highest bit of the 3 bit counter is what increments the address pointer for pointing to the next phoneme in mirrored mode
