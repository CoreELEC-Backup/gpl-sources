    <para>This boolean parameter controls whether
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will disable
    lock sequence checking even for multi-channel connections
    as well as durable handles.
    </para>

    <para>The [MS-SMB2] specification (under 3.3.5.14 Receiving an SMB2 LOCK Request)
    documents that a server should do lock sequence if Open.IsResilient or Open.IsDurable
    or Open.IsPersistent is TRUE or if Connection.Dialect belongs to the SMB 3.x dialect
    family and Connection.ServerCapabilities includes SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_MULTI_CHANNEL.
    </para>

    <para>But Windows Server (at least up to v2004) only does these checks
    for the Open.IsResilient and Open.IsPersistent.
    That means they do not implement the behavior specified
    in [MS-SMB2].</para>

    <para>By default Samba behaves according to the specification
    and sends smb2 oplock break notification retries.</para>

    <para>Warning: Only enable this option if existing clients can't
    handle lock sequence checking for handles without Open.IsResilient and Open.IsPersistent.
    And it turns out that the Windows Server behavior is required.</para>

    <para>Note: it's likely that this option will be removed again
    if future Windows versions change their behavior.</para>

    <para>Note: Samba does not implement Open.IsResilient and Open.IsPersistent yet.</para>
