REMOTE FILESYSTEM
-----------------

Mega.nz filesystem is represented as a tree of nodes of various types. Nodes
are identified by a 8 character node handles (eg. `7Fdi3ZjC`). Structure of the
filesystem is not encrypted.

Megatools maps node tree structure to a traditional filesystem paths (eg.
`/Root/SomeFile.DAT`). 

*NOTE*: By the nature of Mega.nz storage, several files in the directory can
have the same name. To allow access to such files, the names of conflicting
files are extended by appending dot and their node handle like this:

---------
/Root/conflictingfile
/Root/conflictingfile.7Fdi3ZjC
/Root/conflictingfile.mEU23aSD
---------

You need to be aware of several special folders:

/Root::
	Writable directory representing the root of the filesystem.

/Trash::
	Trash directory where Mega.nz web client moves deleted files. This
	directory is not used by megatools when removing files.

/Inbox::
	Not sure.

/Contacts::
	Directory containing subdirectories representing your contacts list. If
	you want to add contacts to the list, simply create subdirectory named
	after the contact you want to add.

/Contacts/<email>::
	Directories representing individual contacts in your contacts list. These
	directories contain folders that others shared with you. All shared
	files are read-only, at the moment.
