- include Apple patches and improvements (if possible/needed)

- allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two different machines.
  That would be needed to support remote PAM login.
  Maybe use unix2tcp (http://dizzy.roedu.net/unix2tcp/)

- manage power suspend/resume (in a laptop for example) and coordinate
  with the driver (when/if possible)
