## What is LIRC?

LIRC is a package that allows you to decode and send infra-red signals
of many (but not all) commonly used remote controls. Pre-release versions
are currently available at the LIRC homepage: http://www.lirc.org/

Former versions focused on home-brew hardware connected to the serial
or parallel port. Descriptions how to build this hardware can be found
on the LIRC homepage. Current versions of LIRC also support a variety
of other hardware. An up-to-date list of all supported devices and the
status of the according drivers is available on the LIRC homepage.

The most important part of LIRC is the lircd daemon which decodes IR
signals received by the device drivers and provides the information
on a socket. It also accepts commands for IR signals to be sent if
the hardware supports this.

The user space applications will allow you to control your computer
with your remote control. You can send X events to applications, start
programs and much more on just one button press.  The possible
applications are obvious: Infra-red mouse, remote control for your TV
tuner card or CD-ROM, shutdown by remote, program your VCR and/or
satellite tuner with your computer, etc.

Since some time some of the LIRC functionality has been moved to the
kernel. However, LIRC still adds functionality and flexibility to the
basic kernel IR remote handling.
