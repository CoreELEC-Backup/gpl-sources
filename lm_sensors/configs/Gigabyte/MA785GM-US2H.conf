### Voltages

   # in7 is mysterious, it lives in the range 2.19 to 2.94 V, change with
   # CPU frequency (if you take the highest clock speed of all the cores
   # you can guess it's value). No idea what it can be.

   label  in0  "Vcore"
   label  in1  "Vram"    # "DDR2" in BIOS
   label  in2  "+3.3V"
   label  in3  "+5V"     # Not in BIOS
   label  in4  "+12V"
   ignore in5            # Always fixed at 4.08 V
   ignore in6            # Always fixed at 4.02 V
   ignore in7            # Commented above
   label  in8  "Vbat"    # Not in BIOS

   # Vcore, Vram, +3.3V and Vbat are connected directly, so no compute
   # line is needed for these. For +5V the chip is configured to use
   # internal scaling. For +12V, my guess is that the BIOS uses 4 as
   # the scaling factor. Not sure if it matches the physical reality.
   # BIOS values varies between 12.048 and 12.112 V, lm-sensors in4
   # between 3.040 and 3.056 V, is exactly a x4 scale +0.112 offset.

   compute  in3  @ * (6.8/10+1),   @ / (6.8/10+1)
   compute  in4  @ * ((30/10)+1),  @ / ((30/10)+1)

   # The BIOS won't set any limit for voltages.
   # You should set Vcore and Vram to match you setup, mine is:
   # - CPU: AMD Athlon II X2 250 (VCore 0.85-1.425)
   # - Mem: KHX8500D2/2G (Vram 1.8-2)

   set in0_min 0.850 * 0.95
   set in0_max 1.425 * 1.05
   set in1_min 1.8 * 0.95
   set in1_max 2.0 * 1.05
   set in2_min 3.3 * 0.95

   set in3_max   5 * 1.05
   set in4_min  12 * 0.95
   set in4_max  12 * 1.05

### Temperatures

   # The BIOS only shows 2 temperature values, corresponding to Sys and CPU,
   # temp3 is usually similar to Sys temp but under heavy load it raises more.

   label  temp1  "Sys Temp"
   label  temp2  "CPU Temp"
   label  temp3  "NBr Temp"    # Guessed

   set temp1_min 10
   set temp1_max 50
   set temp2_min 10
   set temp2_max 60
   set temp3_min 10
   set temp3_max 50

### Fans

   label  fan1  "CPU Fan"
   label  fan2  "Case Fan"
   ignore fan3
   label  fan4  "NBr Fan"

   # Adjust for your own fans
   set fan1_min 1000
