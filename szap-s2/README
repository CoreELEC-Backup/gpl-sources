szap-s2 requires Linux DVB driver API version 5.0.

If compiler not found DVB headers in ../s2/linux/include/linux/dvb,
then it looks at usual location /usr/include/linux/dvb.

Install as follows:

(Option)  make
          make install
Uninstall
          make uninstall

location of channel list file is ~/.szap/channels.conf

one line of the szap channel file has the following format:
name:frequency_MHz:polarization[coderate][delivery][modulation][rolloff]:sat_no:symbolrate:vpid:apid:service_id
one line of the VDR channel file has the following format:
name:frequency_MHz:polarization[coderate][delivery][modulation][rolloff]:sat_no:symbolrate:vpid:apid:?:?:service_id:?:?:?

usage:
szap -q
         list known channels
szap [options] {-n channel-number|channel_name}
         zap to channel via number or full name (case insensitive)
     -a number : use given adapter (default 0)
     -f number : use given frontend (default 0)
     -d number : use given demux (default 0)
     -c file   : read channels list from 'file'
     -V        : use vdr channels list file format (default zap)
     -b        : enable Audio Bypass (default no)
     -x        : exit after tuning
     -H        : human readable output
     -D        : params debug
     -r        : set up /dev/dvb/adapterX/dvr0 for TS recording
     -l lnb-type (DVB-S Only) (use -l help to print types) or 
     -l low[,high[,switch]] in Mhz
     -i        : run interactively, allowing you to type in channel names
     -p        : add pat and pmt to TS recording (implies -r)
                 or -n numbers for zapping
     -S        : delivery system type DVB-S=0, DVB-S2=1
     -M        : modulation 1=BPSK 2=QPSK 5=8PSK
     -C        : fec 0=NONE 12=1/2 23=2/3 34=3/4 35=3/5 45=4/5 56=5/6 67=6/7 89=8/9 910=9/10 999=AUTO
     -O        : rolloff 35=0.35 25=0.25 20=0.20 0=UNKNOWN
     -m        : input stream 0-255
