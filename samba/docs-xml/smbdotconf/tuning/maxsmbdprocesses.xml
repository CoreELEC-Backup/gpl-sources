    <para>This parameter limits the maximum number of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>                                       
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> processes concurrently running on a system and is intended
    as a stopgap to prevent degrading service to clients in the event that the server has insufficient
    resources to handle more than this number of connections.  Remember that under normal operating
    conditions, each user will have an <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> associated with him or her to handle connections to all
    shares from a given host.</para>

    <para>For a Samba ADDC running the standard process model this option
    limits the number of processes forked to handle requests.
    Currently new processes are only forked for ldap and netlogon
    requests.
