Demo-application "hello" 
========================

This application shows a very simple form and how to process arguments 
received from the form.

It also shows how to compile a image into the application.

To run the application enter "tntnet" in this directory. If you 
have not yet installed but only built tntnet, you need to enter the path to 
the generated tntnet-program: 
  "../../../framework/runtime/tntnet"

You can see the result in your browser at http://localhost:8000/hello
