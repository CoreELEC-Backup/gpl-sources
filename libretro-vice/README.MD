## Recent improvements

- Savestates
- Vice 3.3 update
- x64sc / xpet
- Virtual keyboard revamped: more responsive, cleaner design, much easier to control
- Other GUI removed
- Autostart PRG mode to inject
- System-subdir renamed to vice and created automatically
- Keyrah joystick maps 
- C64 joystick disabled while using virtual keyboard
- Cursor keys disabled while using C64 joystick
- New settings:
  - Drive Sound Emulation + Volume
  - Reset type (autostart, soft, hard)
  - Customizable keymaps for essential functions (virtual keyboard, statusbar, joyport switch, reset, datasette controls)
  - Analog sticks mappable
  - Virtual keyboard themes

## Joyport control via Filename

C64 games sometimes use joystick port 1 and sometimes joystick port 2 for player 1. There are several ways to switch ports in this core:
- Use the core option for it: `Quickmenu->Options->Controller 0` 
- Bring up the virtual keyboard with L shoulder button, and press the key labeled `Joy` there 
- Re-name your games, eg. `Bruce_Lee_j1.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j1).tap` for port 1, and similarly `Bruce_Lee_j2.tap` or `Bruce_Lee_(j2).tap` for port 2. Note this only works with extracted files (`.PRG`, `.D64` etc.) not with zip files. 

## M3U Support and Disk control
When you have a multi disk game, you can use a m3u file to specify each disk of the game and change them from the RetroArch Disk control interface.

A M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U).

Example :

Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems).m3u
```
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side A)(Game).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 1 of 3 Side B)(Surface).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side A)(Dungeon).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 2 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side A)(Populace A).d64
Ultima VI - The False Prophet (1990)(Origin Systems)(Disk 3 of 3 Side B)(Populace A).d64
```
Path can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.

When a game ask for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch 'Disk Control' menu :
- Eject the current disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'.
- Select the right disk index.
- Insert the new disk with 'Disk Cycle Tray Status'.

Note : zip support is provided by RetroArch and is done before passing the game to the core. So, when using a m3u file, the specified disk image must be uncompressed (.d64 file formats).

## Command file operation

Vice command line options are supported with Retroarch by by placing the desired command line in a text file with a .cmd file extension. The command line format is as documented in the Vice documentation (see http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_6.html).

Using this you can overcome limitations of the gui and set advanced configurations required for running problematic files. Here are a couple of examples for the xvic core  ...

Vic20 megacart support:
```
xvic -cartmega /path/to/rom/mega-cart-name.rom
```
Vic20 games which require specific memory configs such as 8k expansion:
```
xvic -memory 1 /path/to/rom/some-8k-game.d64
```

## Build instructions

LIBDIR set to retro_system_dir

Add WANT_RGB565=1 to make for RGB565 16 bits depth (32 bits depth default)

### Linux
```
CC=gcc make -f Makefile.libretro -j10
```
### Win64 (crossbuild)
```
make -f Makefile.libretro platform=wincross64 -j4
```
### Android standalone toolchain Build
```
export path to your standalone toolchain like

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/standtc/bin

make -f Makefile.libretro platform=androidstc -j4
```
### Android ndk Build
```
cd jni
ndk-build
```

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This release stabilizes and introduces the GTK3 UI as the primary user 
 interface for all major ports. For "lesser" platforms we still have the SDL 
 based interface. All other user interfaces have been removed. RIP

 We are still looking for dedicated maintainers for the Windows- and macOS 
 ports, if you want to help improving these and/or want to provide binaries, 
 please get in touch.
