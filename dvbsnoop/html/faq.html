	 <P>Some questions and answers...</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI><B>Q: What is dvbsnoop?</B><BR>dvbsnoop is a mpeg analyzer for
		  viewing/debugging mpeg or dvb based stream information, send via digital TV.
		  You may also use dvbsnoop to analyze mpeg compliant streams stored on DVD or
		  other media... dvbsnoop analayzes and displays mpeg, dvb dsm-cc, mhp, etc. data
		  and structures in human readable form. dvbsnoop is not designed to be fault
		  tolerant - damaged or braindead stream information could lead to odd
		  results.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Under what license is dvbsnoop?</B><BR>dvbsnoop is published
		  under "GPL". <BR><BR></LI>
		<LI><B>Q: May I re-use dvbsnoop code or ideas for my own
		  project?</B><BR>dvbsnoop is published under "GPL". So yes, you may recycle
		  dvbsnoop code, if you are publishing your project under GPL, too. If you are
		  using dvbsnoop (basics, ideas, code), please place a link/note to the dvbsnoop
		  homepage in your project.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: What is DVB and digital TV?</B><BR>Have a look at
		  <A HREF="http://www.dvb.org" TARGET="_blank">http://www.dvb.org</A>. Also
		  <A HREF="http://www.google.com" TARGET="_blank">Google</A> is very helpfull for
		  explanations.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: What features does dvbsnoop provide?</B><BR>Have a look at the
		  <A HREF="features.html">feature list</A>...<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Is there a BBS or newsgroup/maillist to ask
		  questions?</B><BR>Well, you might use the
		  <A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/mailinglists.xml">linuxtv maillinglist</A> (or
		  post a question to the <A HREF="http://tuxbox.org/forum/">tuxbox forum</A>
		  (German BBS, but you may also post questions in English).)..<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: I found a bug, what to do?</B><BR>Interaction between standards
		  organizations (ETSI, ITU, ISO, ...) and also between standards itself sometimes
		  is very complex, especially when standards are enhanced or collide with other
		  drafts. So bugs are very likely (also programming bugs...). Due to missing or
		  proper test streams, some features are implemented without possible real life
		  testing... <B>Please report any bug or odd behavior.</B><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: How do I know the PIDs to sniff on?</B><BR>The PAT section
		  ("dvbsnoop -nph 0x01") provides the necessary information. Use program PIDs in
		  the PAT to decode the PMT section.<BR>To see if there are any "hidden" PIDs,
		  use "dvbsnoop -s pidscan".<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI><B>Q: How do I tune into a frequency with dvbsnoop?</B><BR>dvbsnoop
		  doesn't do tuning. It's only designed to sniff...<BR>Use dvbtune, or a GUI like
		  dbox2 "Neutrino" to tune into a transponder or frequency...<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Why can't I snoop the PID 0x1FFF?</B><BR>PID 0x1FFF is a NULL
		  packet, used for stuffing. The availablity of this PID depends on the firmware
		  (ucodes) of your dvb hardware.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Why can't I snoop some PIDs?</B><BR>Depending on your DVB card
		  firmware or driver, a PID which is already occupied by another process may not
		  be available to dvbsnoop. In this case close all dvb applications (TV-,
		  streaming-, EPG-applications).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Can I snoop multiple PIDs?</B><BR>Currently not (DVB-API 1 and
		  DVB-API 3). But there is a workaround: depending on your DVB hardware you may
		  save a complete transport stream (raw binary data) or a multiple pid transport
		  stream as file. You can analyze this transport stream using "dvbsnoop -s ts
		  -tssubdecode -if filename ..."<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Can dvbsnoop "follow" PIDs?</B><BR>Yes. Use the option
		  "-spiderpid". This will enable dvbsnoop to recursivly follow PIDs. Use also
		  option "-n &lt;count&gt;" to limit PID read cycles...<BR><BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Why can't I see any data analyzed by dvbsnoop?</B><BR>Did you
		  tune into a valid transponder/frequency containing a DVB stream? Use dvbtune,
		  szap, VDR, Neutrino, Enigma or any other tool to tune to a DVB service
		  (program)... Use "dvbsnoop -signal" to check if you are tuned and locked into a
		  transponder and are in-sync.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: What to do on "read error , buffer overflow"?</B><BR>The dvb
		  data stream on the selected PID is too fast for dvbsnoop to decode. Packets are
		  lost. The reason for this might be high PID bandwidth, slow cpu (e.g. a set top
		  box - PCs should have sufficient cpu power), or output is sent to a "slow"
		  terminal (e.g. via network connection). To avoid this, save the binary stream
		  to file (option -b) and analyze the stream file. If the buffer overlow still
		  consists while saving the stream to a file, try to save the stream to a fast
		  media (e.g. virtual disk/ram disk, - on many systems /tmp might be such a ram
		  file system). <BR><BR>As of version 1.3.69 you might use the command line
		  option "-buffersize xxxx" to set a larger demux buffersize. Size will be given
		  in KBytes (see usage description or feature list). dvbsnoop's default
		  buffersize is 256 KBytes.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: I get strange output on PES, TS or SECTIONs...</B><BR>Use the
		  options -sync or -crc to enforce valid data. If a packet is delivered in sync
		  to dvbsnoop, depends on your DVB hardware/firmware. Also I observed that some
		  firmware is clearing the "scrambled" flag in TS packets, even if the transport
		  stream or PES is scrambled or wrongly descrambled (e.g. because you didn't
		  subscribe to this channel). dvbsnoop tries to analyze the stream as unscrambled
		  stream (which will lead to odd analyzing reports, of course).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Why is the command option "-sync" default and otherwise on
		  SECTIONs mode "-nocrc" default?</B><BR>Unsynced TS or PES is useless, because
		  decoding will be completly gaga. On sections -nocrc is default, because there
		  might be private sections (e.g. ECM) or DSM-CC sections with no or different
		  CRC calculations (e.g. dsm-cc datagram).<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Can I filter or customize the dvbsnoop output?</B><BR>On Unix
		  you may find many tools to tweak or filter the output of dvbsnoop, using
		  "grep", "nawk", "perl" or other stuff.. (e.g.: dvbsnoop -nph 0x00 | grep -i
		  "pid").<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Can I filter dvb input?</B><BR>Currently you only can filter
		  dvb stream input, using PID filters on sections and when reading from a
		  transport stream file. But plans are to enhance input filter capabilities.
		  There are requests by different persons: positive/negative filter mask,
		  filtering "bytes" on specified packet positions, and also requests for really
		  enhanced content (output) filters. <BR><BR></LI>
		<LI><B>Q: Can dvbsnoop decode private/user defined
		  data?</B><BR>Basically: Yes. You have to tell dvbsnoop which provider's private
		  scope to use. (e.g. commandline option: "-privateprovider premiere.de"). If
		  dvbsnoop is aware of this provider, it will decode the private data
		  structures.<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI><B>Q: Can dvbsnoop decode the private data of provider/service
		  XYZ?</B><BR>Try "dvbsnoop -help", to see if the provider name is listed. If
		  not, someone has to send information about the private descriptors and tables
		  to the author.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Does dvbsnoop analyze MPEG video/audio stream
		  content?</B><BR>dvbsnoop decodes meta information about dvb and mpeg streams,
		  but does not analyze video or audio stream content, which is described outside
		  ISO/IEC 13818-1 / ITU H.222.0. There are other good tools available to analyze
		  e.g. mpeg video I-frame rates, compression rates, mpeg vectors, etc.. You may
		  use dvbsnoop in combination with these tools.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Will there be a XML output option for dvbsnoop?</B><BR>
		  Planned... But it needs major rewriting of some dvbsnoop routines and behavior.
		  ... and time...<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Will there be a graphical interface for dvbsnoop?</B><BR>Well,
		  who knows what future will bring. But currently there are no plans. (Maybe
		  someone wish to start a project ;-))<BR>But you can use some easy
		  perl-/shellscripts and tools like GNU-PLOT or MRTG to create fancy graphics
		  from dvbsnoop output (e.g. bitrate figures, pid usage, etc.). <BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Will there be a Windows port?</B><BR>Currently no plans,
		  because you would need the DVB-API on Windows.<BR><BR></LI> 
		<LI><B>Q: Future development of dvbsnoop?</B><BR>I'm also involved in
		  other projects and too bad for my software projects: there is also a "real"
		  life... ;-)<BR>So, future development of dvbsnoop depends on my sparetime for
		  dvbsnoop...<BR>But if you are interrested in enhancing dvbsnoop, any help is
		  welcome...<BR><BR><BR></LI>
