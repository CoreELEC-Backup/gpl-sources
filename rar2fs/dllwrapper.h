    This is a C/C++ wrapper for the extension of the freeware Unrar C++
    library (libunrar). It is part of the extension itself. The wrapper
    can be used in source code written in C in order to access and 
    include the C++ library API.

    Unrar source may be used in any software to handle RAR archives
    without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used to re-create
    the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary. Distribution
    of modified Unrar source in separate form or as a part of other
    software is permitted, provided that it is clearly stated in
    the documentation and source comments that the code may not be used
    to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
