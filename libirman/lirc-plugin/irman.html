 <center><h1>irman driver.</h1></center>

<p>
The irman driver is originally developed for the irman devices, see
http://www.intolect.com/irmandetail.htm. These are nowadays discontinued.
However, some modern hardware (notably the irtoy) is able to emulate
the irman protocol.</p>
<p>
The driver is a LIRC_MODE2 driver which gives timing information
and thus can be used with most remotes. It expects a /dev/tty* type of
device option, defaulting to /dev/ttyS0.</p>
<p>
The driver does not support transmitting (IR blasting).</p>
