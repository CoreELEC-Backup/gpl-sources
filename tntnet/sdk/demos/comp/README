Demo-application "subcomp" 
==========================

This application shows various ways to embed subcomponents into a page and how
to pass parameters to them.

To run the application enter "tntnet" in this directory. If you 
have not yet installed but only built tntnet, you need to enter the path to 
the generated tntnet-program: 
  "../../../framework/runtime/tntnet"

You can see the result (various examples, how to ebed components including
an explanation) in your browser at http://localhost:8000/comp
