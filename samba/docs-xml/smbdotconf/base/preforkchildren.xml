	<para>This option controls the number of worker processes that are
		started for each service when prefork process model is enabled
		(see <citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
			<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> -M)
		The prefork children are only started for those services that
		support prefork (currently ldap, kdc and netlogon).
		For processes that don't support preforking all requests are
		handled by a single process for that service.
	</para>

	<para>This should be set to a small multiple of the number of CPU's
		available on the server</para>

	<para>Additionally the number of prefork children can be specified for
		an individual service by using "prefork children: service name"
		i.e. "prefork children:ldap = 8" to set the number of ldap
		worker processes.</para>
